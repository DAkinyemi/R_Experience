These findings can relate to our article about Lynchings in the south and how the absense of information made it alot more diffcult to make reliable conclusions. The topics I found though do not make much sense to me and can relate to the article that explains how computational programs can faciliate a lot of work but the results it provides only holds as much meaning as you give it.

From Biddeford, well actually we moved to Houlton first, couple of years we were in Houlton, my father had to find work, so then the mill where he worked kind of, you know, they kind of lapsed and so we moved to Biddeford where there was work.

Once that's full, when the machine goes back by, that cheese stays down so you have to take it off and put on a new starter. So that was the spoolers. And unicorners, well it was almost the same thing, they made cheeses also, but it was a lower machine and not as long. You just fed the like bobbins around and that would pick up, too, and make the same things, like cheeses. So that was what I did when I went back. And then I, they laid me off again after, well I worked in that department for probably close to eleven years, then I was laid off and I went to the sample department, worked there for a little while. 2 Then I put my name to work in the finishing room, and I got a job in the finishing room. So I worked there for quite a while, too. Then I was laid off, kept laying me off and the work was getting slower, so then they'd send me to the weave room, I worked in the weave room for a little while and then they called me back on my job in the yarn, not the yarn department but the finishing department, so I'd go back down there and then they laid me off again. So then one of the bosses, Mr. Provencer in the weave room saw my name on the list of laid offs and said, I want her to come back to work for me. So I went back in the weave room and worked there for seven months making the heads, putting up strings for the heads of the patterns, the patterns, the designs come through, so I worked there for seven years, sweating.</td></tr>\n",

You could see the whole finishing room, you know, stitchers and folders and all that. I couldn't believe how many people were in that room.

Well, you know, once there, we were just sixteen years old then, and there was this man, well we tried to get this man and this lady together, and we'd tell her that he was interested in him [sic] and we'd tell him that she was interested in him, trying to get them together. And one, I don't know if they ever did, but anyways one time this man was always wearing the same clothes, and they were kind of filthy, so my friend and I, well let's get him, have him change those clothes. So my friend was talking to him while I was spraying him with oil, we were spraying him with oil, I was spraying him with oil, and then when he noticed what we were doing, he was so upset.

And so every time it came like six o'clock in the morning she'd really be tired and wanting to sleep. And on the spoolers, you know, you have to keep feeding this machine, because when it goes around if there's no thread in, you know, no bobbins and threads hanging up there for it to pick up, then all the cheeses come back down and it makes them soft, and they didn't like that. So, you know, you had to try to fill up that machine. I can't remember how many bobbins you have to put in before it came around, must have been three hundred and something bobbins that you had to do. And if you had a bad bobbin that was, you know, bad that you couldn't pull it out fast, you were having a hard time and you had to have that machine filled before it goes by. So plenty of times we couldn't fill it, we didn't have time, the machine would go by and -. Anyways, when it would stop on the end for not too long, then you'd try to pick up but then sometimes you still, if you had like I say bad bobbins and if you were slow, well of course the machine went by and you had, didn't have time to fill it. Anyways, one time my aunt was like, you know, was kind of getting tired and she was sleeping standing up, and she was still working, she was still putting on thread but she was sleeping, just standing there. And I happened to look at her and I said, oh, my goodness, I'd better go wake her up. So I went 5 over and I told, kind of, not to scare her, and I told her, I said, woke her up, and she didn't know, she didn't realize that she was doing that. But just standing there, and she was still working but nothing was happening. So, and the boss came around the corner at the same time when she finally woke up. So, you know, at that time, in the morning like that, like six o'clock there, you'd start getting tired and sleepy.   </td></tr>\n",

And that's the way we had it. When he went on first and I was still on third, so the kids were in school then so it wasn't as bad. And I'd come home and go to bed, and when they came back from school, well, I was home, you know. So, in the summer, well he was home during the day, so if I was on second or third, well he'd watch the kids, and we had to plan it that way. Plenty of times, too, when he was on second and I was on third, and you know, you get tired at night so you go to bed and try to sleep a couple of hours before you go to work. And the girls, well, I'd say okay, you can watch t.v. but you go to bed by eight o'clock, or whatever, you know. And they'd come, Mom, can we stay another hour, this show we want to watch. And I was so sleepy, okay. And plenty of times my husband would come in and I was still in bed and I didn't get up to go to work. Then I had to rush, really rush. And a lot of times, a couple of times it happened and then finally, well, I was on spooling then, so if you're not there when your, you know, when you start, your work is starting, like eleven o'clock you're not there, they have to strip that machine, that side of the machine because all the cheese would fall back down because there's nothing to tie them. So they'd take them all down, so then I'd come in fifteen minutes late. They didn't like that too much, they'd have to put them all back in. So anyway, I did that maybe, maybe three times. The third time the boss said, don't you have an alarm clock? That was the last time I was late.</td></tr>\n",

I just remember when I first started working at Bates, sixteen years old, you were wearing dresses then. And, you know, today you wear slacks or jeans or whatever, so that was a different time there, because everybody had dresses on. And in the morning the older ladies would go and, where their lockers were, whatever, and they'd change right in front of you. Took off their dresses and you'd see them in slips. That was different than it is later on, it was different because then you'd wear a pair of jeans or slacks and you'd keep them on to go home. It wasn't like it was in those days. And then a lot of times, too, you couldn't wear, you couldn't wear open shoes because of the risk of hurting yourself. You'd have to wear shoes that were harder a little bit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        </td></tr>\n",

Well, one girl was working on another machine, I can't recall the name of it, but she had her finger cut off. So they rushed her to the hospital I guess, and then somebody else, somebody came and looked for the rest of the finger, and they found it and they passed in back of me with a finger, I almost passed out. So that 6 was one thing that I remember of an accident. In another, well myself, when I was spooling and the bobbins got stuck sometimes on the strap, so I had gone, put my hand in there to kind of loosen them up, and one of them came up and caught my finger there and I couldn't get it out. So of course they came and shut the machine, and then that was really cut and it was really hurting, that was on third shift, so the boss brought me down to the nurse's station and there was nobody there because it was third shift. So he called the doctor and the doctor came down. I was laying down, but the boss was walking around and walking around, he was all white and nervous. And anyways, the doctor came and stitched it.

From Biddeford, well actually we moved to Houlton first, couple of years we were in Houlton, my father had to find work, so then the mill where he worked kind of, you know, they kind of lapsed and so we moved to Biddeford where there was work.

Once that's full, when the machine goes back by, that cheese stays down so you have to take it off and put on a new starter. So that was the spoolers. And unicorners, well it was almost the same thing, they made cheeses also, but it was a lower machine and not as long. You just fed the like bobbins around and that would pick up, too, and make the same things, like cheeses. So that was what I did when I went back. And then I, they laid me off again after, well I worked in that department for probably close to eleven years, then I was laid off and I went to the sample department, worked there for a little while. 2 Then I put my name to work in the finishing room, and I got a job in the finishing room. So I worked there for quite a while, too. Then I was laid off, kept laying me off and the work was getting slower, so then they'd send me to the weave room, I worked in the weave room for a little while and then they called me back on my job in the yarn, not the yarn department but the finishing department, so I'd go back down there and then they laid me off again. So then one of the bosses, Mr. Provencer in the weave room saw my name on the list of laid offs and said, I want her to come back to work for me. So I went back in the weave room and worked there for seven months making the heads, putting up strings for the heads of the patterns, the patterns, the designs come through, so I worked there for seven years, sweating.\\\\\n",

You could see the whole finishing room, you know, stitchers and folders and all that. I couldn't believe how many people were in that room.

Well, you know, once there, we were just sixteen years old then, and there was this man, well we tried to get this man and this lady together, and we'd tell her that he was interested in him {[}sic{]} and we'd tell him that she was interested in him, trying to get them together. And one, I don't know if they ever did, but anyways one time this man was always wearing the same clothes, and they were kind of filthy, so my friend and I, well let's get him, have him change those clothes. So my friend was talking to him while I was spraying him with oil, we were spraying him with oil, I was spraying him with oil, and then when he noticed what we were doing, he was so upset.

And so every time it came like six o'clock in the morning she'd really be tired and wanting to sleep. And on the spoolers, you know, you have to keep feeding this machine, because when it goes around if there's no thread in, you know, no bobbins and threads hanging up there for it to pick up, then all the cheeses come back down and it makes them soft, and they didn't like that. So, you know, you had to try to fill up that machine. I can't remember how many bobbins you have to put in before it came around, must have been three hundred and something bobbins that you had to do. And if you had a bad bobbin that was, you know, bad that you couldn't pull it out fast, you were having a hard time and you had to have that machine filled before it goes by. So plenty of times we couldn't fill it, we didn't have time, the machine would go by and -. Anyways, when it would stop on the end for not too long, then you'd try to pick up but then sometimes you still, if you had like I say bad bobbins and if you were slow, well of course the machine went by and you had, didn't have time to fill it. Anyways, one time my aunt was like, you know, was kind of getting tired and she was sleeping standing up, and she was still working, she was still putting on thread but she was sleeping, just standing there. And I happened to look at her and I said, oh, my goodness, I'd better go wake her up. So I went 5 over and I told, kind of, not to scare her, and I told her, I said, woke her up, and she didn't know, she didn't realize that she was doing that. But just standing there, and she was still working but nothing was happening. So, and the boss came around the corner at the same time when she finally woke up. So, you know, at that time, in the morning like that, like six o'clock there, you'd start getting tired and sleepy.   \\\\\n",

And that's the way we had it. When he went on first and I was still on third, so the kids were in school then so it wasn't as bad. And I'd come home and go to bed, and when they came back from school, well, I was home, you know. So, in the summer, well he was home during the day, so if I was on second or third, well he'd watch the kids, and we had to plan it that way. Plenty of times, too, when he was on second and I was on third, and you know, you get tired at night so you go to bed and try to sleep a couple of hours before you go to work. And the girls, well, I'd say okay, you can watch t.v. but you go to bed by eight o'clock, or whatever, you know. And they'd come, Mom, can we stay another hour, this show we want to watch. And I was so sleepy, okay. And plenty of times my husband would come in and I was still in bed and I didn't get up to go to work. Then I had to rush, really rush. And a lot of times, a couple of times it happened and then finally, well, I was on spooling then, so if you're not there when your, you know, when you start, your work is starting, like eleven o'clock you're not there, they have to strip that machine, that side of the machine because all the cheese would fall back down because there's nothing to tie them. So they'd take them all down, so then I'd come in fifteen minutes late. They didn't like that too much, they'd have to put them all back in. So anyway, I did that maybe, maybe three times. The third time the boss said, don't you have an alarm clock? That was the last time I was late.\\\\\n",

I just remember when I first started working at Bates, sixteen years old, you were wearing dresses then. And, you know, today you wear slacks or jeans or whatever, so that was a different time there, because everybody had dresses on. And in the morning the older ladies would go and, where their lockers were, whatever, and they'd change right in front of you. Took off their dresses and you'd see them in slips. That was different than it is later on, it was different because then you'd wear a pair of jeans or slacks and you'd keep them on to go home. It wasn't like it was in those days. And then a lot of times, too, you couldn't wear, you couldn't wear open shoes because of the risk of hurting yourself. You'd have to wear shoes that were harder a little bit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \\\\\n",

Well, one girl was working on another machine, I can't recall the name of it, but she had her finger cut off. So they rushed her to the hospital I guess, and then somebody else, somebody came and looked for the rest of the finger, and they found it and they passed in back of me with a finger, I almost passed out. So that 6 was one thing that I remember of an accident. In another, well myself, when I was spooling and the bobbins got stuck sometimes on the strap, so I had gone, put my hand in there to kind of loosen them up, and one of them came up and caught my finger there and I couldn't get it out. So of course they came and shut the machine, and then that was really cut and it was really hurting, that was on third shift, so the boss brought me down to the nurse's station and there was nobody there because it was third shift. So he called the doctor and the doctor came down. I was laying down, but the boss was walking around and walking around, he was all white and nervous. And anyways, the doctor came and stitched it.

From Biddeford, well actually we moved to Houlton first, couple of years we were in Houlton, my father had to find work, so then the mill where he worked kind of, you know, they kind of lapsed and so we moved to Biddeford where there was work.

Once that's full, when the machine goes back by, that cheese stays down so you have to take it off and put on a new starter. So that was the spoolers. And unicorners, well it was almost the same thing, they made cheeses also, but it was a lower machine and not as long. You just fed the like bobbins around and that would pick up, too, and make the same things, like cheeses. So that was what I did when I went back. And then I, they laid me off again after, well I worked in that department for probably close to eleven years, then I was laid off and I went to the sample department, worked there for a little while. 2 Then I put my name to work in the finishing room, and I got a job in the finishing room. So I worked there for quite a while, too. Then I was laid off, kept laying me off and the work was getting slower, so then they'd send me to the weave room, I worked in the weave room for a little while and then they called me back on my job in the yarn, not the yarn department but the finishing department, so I'd go back down there and then they laid me off again. So then one of the bosses, Mr. Provencer in the weave room saw my name on the list of laid offs and said, I want her to come back to work for me. So I went back in the weave room and worked there for seven months making the heads, putting up strings for the heads of the patterns, the patterns, the designs come through, so I worked there for seven years, sweating. | \n",

You could see the whole finishing room, you know, stitchers and folders and all that. I couldn't believe how many people were in that room.

Well, you know, once there, we were just sixteen years old then, and there was this man, well we tried to get this man and this lady together, and we'd tell her that he was interested in him [sic] and we'd tell him that she was interested in him, trying to get them together. And one, I don't know if they ever did, but anyways one time this man was always wearing the same clothes, and they were kind of filthy, so my friend and I, well let's get him, have him change those clothes. So my friend was talking to him while I was spraying him with oil, we were spraying him with oil, I was spraying him with oil, and then when he noticed what we were doing, he was so upset.

And we worked on third shift, which was very hard, you know, you're always sleepy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | \n",

And so every time it came like six o'clock in the morning she'd really be tired and wanting to sleep. And on the spoolers, you know, you have to keep feeding this machine, because when it goes around if there's no thread in, you know, no bobbins and threads hanging up there for it to pick up, then all the cheeses come back down and it makes them soft, and they didn't like that. So, you know, you had to try to fill up that machine. I can't remember how many bobbins you have to put in before it came around, must have been three hundred and something bobbins that you had to do. And if you had a bad bobbin that was, you know, bad that you couldn't pull it out fast, you were having a hard time and you had to have that machine filled before it goes by. So plenty of times we couldn't fill it, we didn't have time, the machine would go by and -. Anyways, when it would stop on the end for not too long, then you'd try to pick up but then sometimes you still, if you had like I say bad bobbins and if you were slow, well of course the machine went by and you had, didn't have time to fill it. Anyways, one time my aunt was like, you know, was kind of getting tired and she was sleeping standing up, and she was still working, she was still putting on thread but she was sleeping, just standing there. And I happened to look at her and I said, oh, my goodness, I'd better go wake her up. So I went 5 over and I told, kind of, not to scare her, and I told her, I said, woke her up, and she didn't know, she didn't realize that she was doing that. But just standing there, and she was still working but nothing was happening. So, and the boss came around the corner at the same time when she finally woke up. So, you know, at that time, in the morning like that, like six o'clock there, you'd start getting tired and sleepy.    | \n",

And that's the way we had it. When he went on first and I was still on third, so the kids were in school then so it wasn't as bad. And I'd come home and go to bed, and when they came back from school, well, I was home, you know. So, in the summer, well he was home during the day, so if I was on second or third, well he'd watch the kids, and we had to plan it that way. Plenty of times, too, when he was on second and I was on third, and you know, you get tired at night so you go to bed and try to sleep a couple of hours before you go to work. And the girls, well, I'd say okay, you can watch t.v. but you go to bed by eight o'clock, or whatever, you know. And they'd come, Mom, can we stay another hour, this show we want to watch. And I was so sleepy, okay. And plenty of times my husband would come in and I was still in bed and I didn't get up to go to work. Then I had to rush, really rush. And a lot of times, a couple of times it happened and then finally, well, I was on spooling then, so if you're not there when your, you know, when you start, your work is starting, like eleven o'clock you're not there, they have to strip that machine, that side of the machine because all the cheese would fall back down because there's nothing to tie them. So they'd take them all down, so then I'd come in fifteen minutes late. They didn't like that too much, they'd have to put them all back in. So anyway, I did that maybe, maybe three times. The third time the boss said, don't you have an alarm clock? That was the last time I was late. | \n",

I just remember when I first started working at Bates, sixteen years old, you were wearing dresses then. And, you know, today you wear slacks or jeans or whatever, so that was a different time there, because everybody had dresses on. And in the morning the older ladies would go and, where their lockers were, whatever, and they'd change right in front of you. Took off their dresses and you'd see them in slips. That was different than it is later on, it was different because then you'd wear a pair of jeans or slacks and you'd keep them on to go home. It wasn't like it was in those days. And then a lot of times, too, you couldn't wear, you couldn't wear open shoes because of the risk of hurting yourself. You'd have to wear shoes that were harder a little bit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | \n",

Well, one girl was working on another machine, I can't recall the name of it, but she had her finger cut off. So they rushed her to the hospital I guess, and then somebody else, somebody came and looked for the rest of the finger, and they found it and they passed in back of me with a finger, I almost passed out. So that 6 was one thing that I remember of an accident. In another, well myself, when I was spooling and the bobbins got stuck sometimes on the strap, so I had gone, put my hand in there to kind of loosen them up, and one of them came up and caught my finger there and I couldn't get it out. So of course they came and shut the machine, and then that was really cut and it was really hurting, that was on third shift, so the boss brought me down to the nurse's station and there was nobody there because it was third shift. So he called the doctor and the doctor came down. I was laying down, but the boss was walking around and walking around, he was all white and nervous. And anyways, the doctor came and stitched it.

       "9  No, we moved from up north in, I was eight years old, moved to Biddeford, Maine. From Biddeford, well actually we moved to Houlton first, couple of years we were in Houlton, my father had to find work, so then the mill where he worked kind of, you know, they kind of lapsed and so we moved to Biddeford where there was work.

       "25 Yeah, they hired you at sixteen, but I worked for a little while and then they passed a law that you had to be eighteen to work on the machines, so they laid me off. And then they called me back when I was eighteen, so I went back but then I got married so I quit. And I didn't go back until later on, after the kids were, my youngest daughter was about five years old, and I went back to Bates. And from then on a lot of times I was laid off, because they didn't have much work. But then they'd call me back, I'd go back. And then I, after the kids were born I didn't work for a while. Then in 1971 I went back to Bates, worked in the yarn department. I was there for probably eleven years, and then I went to - (Break in taping.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",

       "29 Okay, spoolers are like you have to feed the machine, a long machine, you have to feed them, put in the bobbins and put up the threads so that when the machine passes by it picks up the threads and hooks it up onto, they call it a cheese, and it's on a drum so they wind around and they make a big cheese. Once that's full, when the machine goes back by, that cheese stays down so you have to take it off and put on a new starter. So that was the spoolers. And unicorners, well it was almost the same thing, they made cheeses also, but it was a lower machine and not as long. You just fed the like bobbins around and that would pick up, too, and make the same things, like cheeses. So that was what I did when I went back. And then I, they laid me off again after, well I worked in that department for probably close to eleven years, then I was laid off and I went to the sample department, worked there for a little while. 2 Then I put my name to work in the finishing room, and I got a job in the finishing room. So I worked there for quite a while, too. Then I was laid off, kept laying me off and the work was getting slower, so then they'd send me to the weave room, I worked in the weave room for a little while and then they called me back on my job in the yarn, not the yarn department but the finishing department, so I'd go back down there and then they laid me off again. So then one of the bosses, Mr. Provencer in the weave room saw my name on the list of laid offs and said, I want her to come back to work for me. So I went back in the weave room and worked there for seven months making the heads, putting up strings for the heads of the patterns, the patterns, the designs come through, so I worked there for seven years, sweating.                                                                                                                    \n",

       "61 Well, yeah, and the, in the finishing room I, the first time I saw the finishing room I couldn't believe that, because I was working the sample department and the lady brought me into the finishing room and we just stood above them on like a little balcony like, and I can't believe, I've never seen so many women working in one room all together. You could see the whole finishing room, you know, stitchers and folders and all that. I couldn't believe how many people were in that room. But then I went to work in the finishing room after that, and I got friendly with most of those women. And I'm still friends with some of them today. So it was a nice time, nice people.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

       "65 Well, my friend and I played some pranks, but I don't think I'd want to say them. Well, you know, once there, we were just sixteen years old then, and there was this man, well we tried to get this man and this lady together, and we'd tell her that he was interested in him [sic] and we'd tell him that she was interested in him, trying to get them together. And one, I don't know if they ever did, but anyways one time this man was always wearing the same clothes, and they were kind of filthy, so my friend and I, well let's get him, have him change those clothes. So my friend was talking to him while I was spraying him with oil, we were spraying him with oil, I was spraying him with oil, and then when he noticed what we were doing, he was so upset.

       "69 Yes, eleven to seven was third shift. And so every time it came like six o'clock in the morning she'd really be tired and wanting to sleep. And on the spoolers, you know, you have to keep feeding this machine, because when it goes around if there's no thread in, you know, no bobbins and threads hanging up there for it to pick up, then all the cheeses come back down and it makes them soft, and they didn't like that. So, you know, you had to try to fill up that machine. I can't remember how many bobbins you have to put in before it came around, must have been three hundred and something bobbins that you had to do. And if you had a bad bobbin that was, you know, bad that you couldn't pull it out fast, you were having a hard time and you had to have that machine filled before it goes by. So plenty of times we couldn't fill it, we didn't have time, the machine would go by and -. Anyways, when it would stop on the end for not too long, then you'd try to pick up but then sometimes you still, if you had like I say bad bobbins and if you were slow, well of course the machine went by and you had, didn't have time to fill it. Anyways, one time my aunt was like, you know, was kind of getting tired and she was sleeping standing up, and she was still working, she was still putting on thread but she was sleeping, just standing there. And I happened to look at her and I said, oh, my goodness, I'd better go wake her up. So I went 5 over and I told, kind of, not to scare her, and I told her, I said, woke her up, and she didn't know, she didn't realize that she was doing that.

So, you know, at that time, in the morning like that, like six o'clock there, you'd start getting tired and sleepy.   \n",

       "71 No, no, we had to plan it, plan a kind of plan, you know, that, like when he was on second, I was on third, so we'd have, when I'd leave for work before he came home, he'd be on second, I'd just have somebody kind of, the neighbors, you know, kind of keep, just keep an eye for five, ten minutes before he would come home. And that's the way we had it. When he went on first and I was still on third, so the kids were in school then so it wasn't as bad. And I'd come home and go to bed, and when they came back from school, well, I was home, you know. So, in the summer, well he was home during the day, so if I was on second or third, well he'd watch the kids, and we had to plan it that way. Plenty of times, too, when he was on second and I was on third, and you know, you get tired at night so you go to bed and try to sleep a couple of hours before you go to work. And the girls, well, I'd say okay, you can watch t.v. but you go to bed by eight o'clock, or whatever, you know. And they'd come, Mom, can we stay another hour, this show we want to watch. And I was so sleepy, okay. And plenty of times my husband would come in and I was still in bed and I didn't get up to go to work. Then I had to rush, really rush. And a lot of times, a couple of times it happened and then finally, well, I was on spooling then, so if you're not there when your, you know, when you start, your work is starting, like eleven o'clock you're not there, they have to strip that machine, that side of the machine because all the cheese would fall back down because there's nothing to tie them. So they'd take them all down, so then I'd come in fifteen minutes late. They didn't like that too much, they'd have to put them all back in. So anyway, I did that maybe, maybe three times. The third time the boss said, don't you have an alarm clock? That was the last time I was late.\n",

       "73 I can't really think of anything. I just remember when I first started working at Bates, sixteen years old, you were wearing dresses then. And, you know, today you wear slacks or jeans or whatever, so that was a different time there, because everybody had dresses on. And in the morning the older ladies would go and, where their lockers were, whatever, and they'd change right in front of you. Took off their dresses and you'd see them in slips. That was different than it is later on, it was different because then you'd wear a pair of jeans or slacks and you'd keep them on to go home. It wasn't like it was in those days. And then a lot of times, too, you couldn't wear, you couldn't wear open shoes because of the risk of hurting yourself.

       "75 Well, I remember one that happened when I was on the spoolers in the yarn department. Well, one girl was working on another machine, I can't recall the name of it, but she had her finger cut off. So they rushed her to the hospital I guess, and then somebody else, somebody came and looked for the rest of the finger, and they found it and they passed in back of me with a finger, I almost passed out. So that 6 was one thing that I remember of an accident. In another, well myself, when I was spooling and the bobbins got stuck sometimes on the strap, so I had gone, put my hand in there to kind of loosen them up, and one of them came up and caught my finger there and I couldn't get it out. So of course they came and shut the machine, and then that was really cut and it was really hurting, that was on third shift, so the boss brought me down to the nurse's station and there was nobody there because it was third shift. So he called the doctor and the doctor came down. I was laying down, but the boss was walking around and walking around, he was all white and nervous. And anyways, the doctor came and stitched it. And the next day when I went back to see the nurse, she opened that up, I almost passed out. I said, please, let me lay down.

       "79 A lot of pictures that I was talking about that we had seen then and we took a few copies of them, that I asked somebody else where they were and they didn't know. So I don't know if, where they ended up. I don't know, because there were some that the workers were in overalls, like, you know, they were down in the, building the canal.

From Biddeford, well actually we moved to Houlton first, couple of years we were in Houlton, my father had to find work, so then the mill where he worked kind of, you know, they kind of lapsed and so we moved to Biddeford where there was work.

And then they called me back when I was eighteen, so I went back but then I got married so I quit. And I didn't go back until later on, after the kids were, my youngest daughter was about five years old, and I went back to Bates. And from then on a lot of times I was laid off, because they didn't have much work. But then they'd call me back, I'd go back. And then I, after the kids were born I didn't work for a while. Then in 1971 I went back to Bates, worked in the yarn department. I was there for probably eleven years, and then I went to - (Break in taping.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   </td></tr>\n",

Once that's full, when the machine goes back by, that cheese stays down so you have to take it off and put on a new starter. So that was the spoolers. And unicorners, well it was almost the same thing, they made cheeses also, but it was a lower machine and not as long. You just fed the like bobbins around and that would pick up, too, and make the same things, like cheeses. So that was what I did when I went back. And then I, they laid me off again after, well I worked in that department for probably close to eleven years, then I was laid off and I went to the sample department, worked there for a little while. 2 Then I put my name to work in the finishing room, and I got a job in the finishing room. So I worked there for quite a while, too. Then I was laid off, kept laying me off and the work was getting slower, so then they'd send me to the weave room, I worked in the weave room for a little while and then they called me back on my job in the yarn, not the yarn department but the finishing department, so I'd go back down there and then they laid me off again. So then one of the bosses, Mr. Provencer in the weave room saw my name on the list of laid offs and said, I want her to come back to work for me. So I went back in the weave room and worked there for seven months making the heads, putting up strings for the heads of the patterns, the patterns, the designs come through, so I worked there for seven years, sweating.                                                                                                                          </td></tr>\n",

And you had to tie those strings, you had to string them all up and then tie, when they hung down you had to put on the little gadgets that they had and you had to tie that in a knot. And then it took almost over a month or so to make one head, so it was a long process. And then after the knot you'd have to tie them with pliers and pull, make them tight, tight, and then you'd have to shellac them so they wouldn't slip off of the, while they were going up and down making the pattern. So then after that, well, they laid me off down there, too, because it was getting slow, so they sent me to the office and I worked in the office for, on the switchboard, for maybe three months. And then the girl that I was replacing came back, because her husband passed away, so I was laid off again. But then they called me back in to work in the office on orders, taking orders, you know, on the computer. But that didn't last too long either because then the Chinese were involved in there then, and so they decided to move all the office work to the Minnette Mills in North Carolina. So then I was laid off again. So then they sent me, they asked me if I would want to go to work at the store, or else be laid off, so I said I'll go to work at the store as a telemarketing, you know, and so I'd have to call in like motels and all that to see if they wanted bedspreads, and I did that for quite a while. And then in the meantime they asked me to work in the store also at the same time when they needed somebody in the store to help them out, so I'd do that and work in the office and the store also at the same time. And so I was there for thirteen years, in the store, until I retired four years ago. So that was about it.</td></tr>\n",

You could see the whole finishing room, you know, stitchers and folders and all that. I couldn't believe how many people were in that room. But then I went to work in the finishing room after that, and I got friendly with most of those women. And I'm still friends with some of them today. So it was a nice time, nice people.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             </td></tr>\n",

Well, you know, once there, we were just sixteen years old then, and there was this man, well we tried to get this man and this lady together, and we'd tell her that he was interested in him [sic] and we'd tell him that she was interested in him, trying to get them together. And one, I don't know if they ever did, but anyways one time this man was always wearing the same clothes, and they were kind of filthy, so my friend and I, well let's get him, have him change those clothes. So my friend was talking to him while I was spraying him with oil, we were spraying him with oil, I was spraying him with oil, and then when he noticed what we were doing, he was so upset.

And so every time it came like six o'clock in the morning she'd really be tired and wanting to sleep. And on the spoolers, you know, you have to keep feeding this machine, because when it goes around if there's no thread in, you know, no bobbins and threads hanging up there for it to pick up, then all the cheeses come back down and it makes them soft, and they didn't like that. So, you know, you had to try to fill up that machine. I can't remember how many bobbins you have to put in before it came around, must have been three hundred and something bobbins that you had to do. And if you had a bad bobbin that was, you know, bad that you couldn't pull it out fast, you were having a hard time and you had to have that machine filled before it goes by. So plenty of times we couldn't fill it, we didn't have time, the machine would go by and -. Anyways, when it would stop on the end for not too long, then you'd try to pick up but then sometimes you still, if you had like I say bad bobbins and if you were slow, well of course the machine went by and you had, didn't have time to fill it. Anyways, one time my aunt was like, you know, was kind of getting tired and she was sleeping standing up, and she was still working, she was still putting on thread but she was sleeping, just standing there. And I happened to look at her and I said, oh, my goodness, I'd better go wake her up. So I went 5 over and I told, kind of, not to scare her, and I told her, I said, woke her up, and she didn't know, she didn't realize that she was doing that. But just standing there, and she was still working but nothing was happening. So, and the boss came around the corner at the same time when she finally woke up. So, you know, at that time, in the morning like that, like six o'clock there, you'd start getting tired and sleepy.         </td></tr>\n",

And that's the way we had it. When he went on first and I was still on third, so the kids were in school then so it wasn't as bad. And I'd come home and go to bed, and when they came back from school, well, I was home, you know. So, in the summer, well he was home during the day, so if I was on second or third, well he'd watch the kids, and we had to plan it that way. Plenty of times, too, when he was on second and I was on third, and you know, you get tired at night so you go to bed and try to sleep a couple of hours before you go to work. And the girls, well, I'd say okay, you can watch t.v. but you go to bed by eight o'clock, or whatever, you know. And they'd come, Mom, can we stay another hour, this show we want to watch. And I was so sleepy, okay. And plenty of times my husband would come in and I was still in bed and I didn't get up to go to work. Then I had to rush, really rush. And a lot of times, a couple of times it happened and then finally, well, I was on spooling then, so if you're not there when your, you know, when you start, your work is starting, like eleven o'clock you're not there, they have to strip that machine, that side of the machine because all the cheese would fall back down because there's nothing to tie them. So they'd take them all down, so then I'd come in fifteen minutes late. They didn't like that too much, they'd have to put them all back in. So anyway, I did that maybe, maybe three times. The third time the boss said, don't you have an alarm clock? That was the last time I was late.      </td></tr>\n",

I just remember when I first started working at Bates, sixteen years old, you were wearing dresses then. And, you know, today you wear slacks or jeans or whatever, so that was a different time there, because everybody had dresses on. And in the morning the older ladies would go and, where their lockers were, whatever, and they'd change right in front of you. Took off their dresses and you'd see them in slips. That was different than it is later on, it was different because then you'd wear a pair of jeans or slacks and you'd keep them on to go home. It wasn't like it was in those days. And then a lot of times, too, you couldn't wear, you couldn't wear open shoes because of the risk of hurting yourself. You'd have to wear shoes that were harder a little bit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              </td></tr>\n",

Well, one girl was working on another machine, I can't recall the name of it, but she had her finger cut off. So they rushed her to the hospital I guess, and then somebody else, somebody came and looked for the rest of the finger, and they found it and they passed in back of me with a finger, I almost passed out. So that 6 was one thing that I remember of an accident. In another, well myself, when I was spooling and the bobbins got stuck sometimes on the strap, so I had gone, put my hand in there to kind of loosen them up, and one of them came up and caught my finger there and I couldn't get it out. So of course they came and shut the machine, and then that was really cut and it was really hurting, that was on third shift, so the boss brought me down to the nurse's station and there was nobody there because it was third shift. So he called the doctor and the doctor came down. I was laying down, but the boss was walking around and walking around, he was all white and nervous. And anyways, the doctor came and stitched it. And the next day when I went back to see the nurse, she opened that up, I almost passed out. I said, please, let me lay down. So, it was all pussey and, yeah, so that's another thing that happened.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       </td></tr>\n",

From Biddeford, well actually we moved to Houlton first, couple of years we were in Houlton, my father had to find work, so then the mill where he worked kind of, you know, they kind of lapsed and so we moved to Biddeford where there was work.

And then they called me back when I was eighteen, so I went back but then I got married so I quit. And I didn't go back until later on, after the kids were, my youngest daughter was about five years old, and I went back to Bates. And from then on a lot of times I was laid off, because they didn't have much work. But then they'd call me back, I'd go back. And then I, after the kids were born I didn't work for a while. Then in 1971 I went back to Bates, worked in the yarn department. I was there for probably eleven years, and then I went to - (Break in taping.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \\\\\n",

Once that's full, when the machine goes back by, that cheese stays down so you have to take it off and put on a new starter. So that was the spoolers. And unicorners, well it was almost the same thing, they made cheeses also, but it was a lower machine and not as long. You just fed the like bobbins around and that would pick up, too, and make the same things, like cheeses. So that was what I did when I went back. And then I, they laid me off again after, well I worked in that department for probably close to eleven years, then I was laid off and I went to the sample department, worked there for a little while. 2 Then I put my name to work in the finishing room, and I got a job in the finishing room. So I worked there for quite a while, too. Then I was laid off, kept laying me off and the work was getting slower, so then they'd send me to the weave room, I worked in the weave room for a little while and then they called me back on my job in the yarn, not the yarn department but the finishing department, so I'd go back down there and then they laid me off again. So then one of the bosses, Mr. Provencer in the weave room saw my name on the list of laid offs and said, I want her to come back to work for me. So I went back in the weave room and worked there for seven months making the heads, putting up strings for the heads of the patterns, the patterns, the designs come through, so I worked there for seven years, sweating.                                                                                                                          \\\\\n",

And you had to tie those strings, you had to string them all up and then tie, when they hung down you had to put on the little gadgets that they had and you had to tie that in a knot. And then it took almost over a month or so to make one head, so it was a long process. And then after the knot you'd have to tie them with pliers and pull, make them tight, tight, and then you'd have to shellac them so they wouldn't slip off of the, while they were going up and down making the pattern. So then after that, well, they laid me off down there, too, because it was getting slow, so they sent me to the office and I worked in the office for, on the switchboard, for maybe three months. And then the girl that I was replacing came back, because her husband passed away, so I was laid off again. But then they called me back in to work in the office on orders, taking orders, you know, on the computer. But that didn't last too long either because then the Chinese were involved in there then, and so they decided to move all the office work to the Minnette Mills in North Carolina. So then I was laid off again. So then they sent me, they asked me if I would want to go to work at the store, or else be laid off, so I said I'll go to work at the store as a telemarketing, you know, and so I'd have to call in like motels and all that to see if they wanted bedspreads, and I did that for quite a while. And then in the meantime they asked me to work in the store also at the same time when they needed somebody in the store to help them out, so I'd do that and work in the office and the store also at the same time. And so I was there for thirteen years, in the store, until I retired four years ago. So that was about it.\\\\\n",

You could see the whole finishing room, you know, stitchers and folders and all that. I couldn't believe how many people were in that room. But then I went to work in the finishing room after that, and I got friendly with most of those women. And I'm still friends with some of them today. So it was a nice time, nice people.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \\\\\n",

Well, you know, once there, we were just sixteen years old then, and there was this man, well we tried to get this man and this lady together, and we'd tell her that he was interested in him {[}sic{]} and we'd tell him that she was interested in him, trying to get them together. And one, I don't know if they ever did, but anyways one time this man was always wearing the same clothes, and they were kind of filthy, so my friend and I, well let's get him, have him change those clothes. So my friend was talking to him while I was spraying him with oil, we were spraying him with oil, I was spraying him with oil, and then when he noticed what we were doing, he was so upset.

And so every time it came like six o'clock in the morning she'd really be tired and wanting to sleep. And on the spoolers, you know, you have to keep feeding this machine, because when it goes around if there's no thread in, you know, no bobbins and threads hanging up there for it to pick up, then all the cheeses come back down and it makes them soft, and they didn't like that. So, you know, you had to try to fill up that machine. I can't remember how many bobbins you have to put in before it came around, must have been three hundred and something bobbins that you had to do. And if you had a bad bobbin that was, you know, bad that you couldn't pull it out fast, you were having a hard time and you had to have that machine filled before it goes by. So plenty of times we couldn't fill it, we didn't have time, the machine would go by and -. Anyways, when it would stop on the end for not too long, then you'd try to pick up but then sometimes you still, if you had like I say bad bobbins and if you were slow, well of course the machine went by and you had, didn't have time to fill it. Anyways, one time my aunt was like, you know, was kind of getting tired and she was sleeping standing up, and she was still working, she was still putting on thread but she was sleeping, just standing there. And I happened to look at her and I said, oh, my goodness, I'd better go wake her up. So I went 5 over and I told, kind of, not to scare her, and I told her, I said, woke her up, and she didn't know, she didn't realize that she was doing that. But just standing there, and she was still working but nothing was happening. So, and the boss came around the corner at the same time when she finally woke up. So, you know, at that time, in the morning like that, like six o'clock there, you'd start getting tired and sleepy.         \\\\\n",

And that's the way we had it. When he went on first and I was still on third, so the kids were in school then so it wasn't as bad. And I'd come home and go to bed, and when they came back from school, well, I was home, you know. So, in the summer, well he was home during the day, so if I was on second or third, well he'd watch the kids, and we had to plan it that way. Plenty of times, too, when he was on second and I was on third, and you know, you get tired at night so you go to bed and try to sleep a couple of hours before you go to work. And the girls, well, I'd say okay, you can watch t.v. but you go to bed by eight o'clock, or whatever, you know. And they'd come, Mom, can we stay another hour, this show we want to watch. And I was so sleepy, okay. And plenty of times my husband would come in and I was still in bed and I didn't get up to go to work. Then I had to rush, really rush. And a lot of times, a couple of times it happened and then finally, well, I was on spooling then, so if you're not there when your, you know, when you start, your work is starting, like eleven o'clock you're not there, they have to strip that machine, that side of the machine because all the cheese would fall back down because there's nothing to tie them. So they'd take them all down, so then I'd come in fifteen minutes late. They didn't like that too much, they'd have to put them all back in. So anyway, I did that maybe, maybe three times. The third time the boss said, don't you have an alarm clock? That was the last time I was late.      \\\\\n",

I just remember when I first started working at Bates, sixteen years old, you were wearing dresses then. And, you know, today you wear slacks or jeans or whatever, so that was a different time there, because everybody had dresses on. And in the morning the older ladies would go and, where their lockers were, whatever, and they'd change right in front of you. Took off their dresses and you'd see them in slips. That was different than it is later on, it was different because then you'd wear a pair of jeans or slacks and you'd keep them on to go home. It wasn't like it was in those days. And then a lot of times, too, you couldn't wear, you couldn't wear open shoes because of the risk of hurting yourself. You'd have to wear shoes that were harder a little bit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \\\\\n",

Well, one girl was working on another machine, I can't recall the name of it, but she had her finger cut off. So they rushed her to the hospital I guess, and then somebody else, somebody came and looked for the rest of the finger, and they found it and they passed in back of me with a finger, I almost passed out. So that 6 was one thing that I remember of an accident. In another, well myself, when I was spooling and the bobbins got stuck sometimes on the strap, so I had gone, put my hand in there to kind of loosen them up, and one of them came up and caught my finger there and I couldn't get it out. So of course they came and shut the machine, and then that was really cut and it was really hurting, that was on third shift, so the boss brought me down to the nurse's station and there was nobody there because it was third shift. So he called the doctor and the doctor came down. I was laying down, but the boss was walking around and walking around, he was all white and nervous. And anyways, the doctor came and stitched it. And the next day when I went back to see the nurse, she opened that up, I almost passed out. I said, please, let me lay down. So, it was all pussey and, yeah, so that's another thing that happened.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \\\\\n",

From Biddeford, well actually we moved to Houlton first, couple of years we were in Houlton, my father had to find work, so then the mill where he worked kind of, you know, they kind of lapsed and so we moved to Biddeford where there was work.

And then they called me back when I was eighteen, so I went back but then I got married so I quit. And I didn't go back until later on, after the kids were, my youngest daughter was about five years old, and I went back to Bates. And from then on a lot of times I was laid off, because they didn't have much work. But then they'd call me back, I'd go back. And then I, after the kids were born I didn't work for a while. Then in 1971 I went back to Bates, worked in the yarn department. I was there for probably eleven years, and then I went to - (Break in taping.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | \n",

Once that's full, when the machine goes back by, that cheese stays down so you have to take it off and put on a new starter. So that was the spoolers. And unicorners, well it was almost the same thing, they made cheeses also, but it was a lower machine and not as long. You just fed the like bobbins around and that would pick up, too, and make the same things, like cheeses. So that was what I did when I went back. And then I, they laid me off again after, well I worked in that department for probably close to eleven years, then I was laid off and I went to the sample department, worked there for a little while. 2 Then I put my name to work in the finishing room, and I got a job in the finishing room. So I worked there for quite a while, too. Then I was laid off, kept laying me off and the work was getting slower, so then they'd send me to the weave room, I worked in the weave room for a little while and then they called me back on my job in the yarn, not the yarn department but the finishing department, so I'd go back down there and then they laid me off again. So then one of the bosses, Mr. Provencer in the weave room saw my name on the list of laid offs and said, I want her to come back to work for me. So I went back in the weave room and worked there for seven months making the heads, putting up strings for the heads of the patterns, the patterns, the designs come through, so I worked there for seven years, sweating.                                                                                                                           | \n",

And you had to tie those strings, you had to string them all up and then tie, when they hung down you had to put on the little gadgets that they had and you had to tie that in a knot. And then it took almost over a month or so to make one head, so it was a long process. And then after the knot you'd have to tie them with pliers and pull, make them tight, tight, and then you'd have to shellac them so they wouldn't slip off of the, while they were going up and down making the pattern. So then after that, well, they laid me off down there, too, because it was getting slow, so they sent me to the office and I worked in the office for, on the switchboard, for maybe three months. And then the girl that I was replacing came back, because her husband passed away, so I was laid off again. But then they called me back in to work in the office on orders, taking orders, you know, on the computer. But that didn't last too long either because then the Chinese were involved in there then, and so they decided to move all the office work to the Minnette Mills in North Carolina. So then I was laid off again. So then they sent me, they asked me if I would want to go to work at the store, or else be laid off, so I said I'll go to work at the store as a telemarketing, you know, and so I'd have to call in like motels and all that to see if they wanted bedspreads, and I did that for quite a while. And then in the meantime they asked me to work in the store also at the same time when they needed somebody in the store to help them out, so I'd do that and work in the office and the store also at the same time. And so I was there for thirteen years, in the store, until I retired four years ago. So that was about it. | \n",

You could see the whole finishing room, you know, stitchers and folders and all that. I couldn't believe how many people were in that room. But then I went to work in the finishing room after that, and I got friendly with most of those women. And I'm still friends with some of them today. So it was a nice time, nice people.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | \n",

Well, you know, once there, we were just sixteen years old then, and there was this man, well we tried to get this man and this lady together, and we'd tell her that he was interested in him [sic] and we'd tell him that she was interested in him, trying to get them together. And one, I don't know if they ever did, but anyways one time this man was always wearing the same clothes, and they were kind of filthy, so my friend and I, well let's get him, have him change those clothes. So my friend was talking to him while I was spraying him with oil, we were spraying him with oil, I was spraying him with oil, and then when he noticed what we were doing, he was so upset.

And so every time it came like six o'clock in the morning she'd really be tired and wanting to sleep. And on the spoolers, you know, you have to keep feeding this machine, because when it goes around if there's no thread in, you know, no bobbins and threads hanging up there for it to pick up, then all the cheeses come back down and it makes them soft, and they didn't like that. So, you know, you had to try to fill up that machine. I can't remember how many bobbins you have to put in before it came around, must have been three hundred and something bobbins that you had to do. And if you had a bad bobbin that was, you know, bad that you couldn't pull it out fast, you were having a hard time and you had to have that machine filled before it goes by. So plenty of times we couldn't fill it, we didn't have time, the machine would go by and -. Anyways, when it would stop on the end for not too long, then you'd try to pick up but then sometimes you still, if you had like I say bad bobbins and if you were slow, well of course the machine went by and you had, didn't have time to fill it. Anyways, one time my aunt was like, you know, was kind of getting tired and she was sleeping standing up, and she was still working, she was still putting on thread but she was sleeping, just standing there. And I happened to look at her and I said, oh, my goodness, I'd better go wake her up. So I went 5 over and I told, kind of, not to scare her, and I told her, I said, woke her up, and she didn't know, she didn't realize that she was doing that. But just standing there, and she was still working but nothing was happening. So, and the boss came around the corner at the same time when she finally woke up. So, you know, at that time, in the morning like that, like six o'clock there, you'd start getting tired and sleepy.          | \n",

And that's the way we had it. When he went on first and I was still on third, so the kids were in school then so it wasn't as bad. And I'd come home and go to bed, and when they came back from school, well, I was home, you know. So, in the summer, well he was home during the day, so if I was on second or third, well he'd watch the kids, and we had to plan it that way. Plenty of times, too, when he was on second and I was on third, and you know, you get tired at night so you go to bed and try to sleep a couple of hours before you go to work. And the girls, well, I'd say okay, you can watch t.v. but you go to bed by eight o'clock, or whatever, you know. And they'd come, Mom, can we stay another hour, this show we want to watch. And I was so sleepy, okay. And plenty of times my husband would come in and I was still in bed and I didn't get up to go to work. Then I had to rush, really rush. And a lot of times, a couple of times it happened and then finally, well, I was on spooling then, so if you're not there when your, you know, when you start, your work is starting, like eleven o'clock you're not there, they have to strip that machine, that side of the machine because all the cheese would fall back down because there's nothing to tie them. So they'd take them all down, so then I'd come in fifteen minutes late. They didn't like that too much, they'd have to put them all back in. So anyway, I did that maybe, maybe three times. The third time the boss said, don't you have an alarm clock? That was the last time I was late.       | \n",

I just remember when I first started working at Bates, sixteen years old, you were wearing dresses then. And, you know, today you wear slacks or jeans or whatever, so that was a different time there, because everybody had dresses on. And in the morning the older ladies would go and, where their lockers were, whatever, and they'd change right in front of you. Took off their dresses and you'd see them in slips. That was different than it is later on, it was different because then you'd wear a pair of jeans or slacks and you'd keep them on to go home. It wasn't like it was in those days. And then a lot of times, too, you couldn't wear, you couldn't wear open shoes because of the risk of hurting yourself. You'd have to wear shoes that were harder a little bit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | \n",

Well, one girl was working on another machine, I can't recall the name of it, but she had her finger cut off. So they rushed her to the hospital I guess, and then somebody else, somebody came and looked for the rest of the finger, and they found it and they passed in back of me with a finger, I almost passed out. So that 6 was one thing that I remember of an accident. In another, well myself, when I was spooling and the bobbins got stuck sometimes on the strap, so I had gone, put my hand in there to kind of loosen them up, and one of them came up and caught my finger there and I couldn't get it out. So of course they came and shut the machine, and then that was really cut and it was really hurting, that was on third shift, so the boss brought me down to the nurse's station and there was nobody there because it was third shift. So he called the doctor and the doctor came down. I was laying down, but the boss was walking around and walking around, he was all white and nervous. And anyways, the doctor came and stitched it. And the next day when I went back to see the nurse, she opened that up, I almost passed out. I said, please, let me lay down.

       "9  No, we moved from up north in, I was eight years old, moved to Biddeford, Maine. From Biddeford, well actually we moved to Houlton first, couple of years we were in Houlton, my father had to find work, so then the mill where he worked kind of, you know, they kind of lapsed and so we moved to Biddeford where there was work. And then from there we moved here, and we lived in Biddeford a couple of years, then we moved here and we've been here since then. So I was twelve years old when we moved here, in Lewiston.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

And we'd shop around, and there was a lot of stores where you could find nice clothes, nice dresses and all that, you know. But today, well, there's not much on Lisbon Street, they're all out, you know, like at the malls and all that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

       "25 Yeah, they hired you at sixteen, but I worked for a little while and then they passed a law that you had to be eighteen to work on the machines, so they laid me off. And then they called me back when I was eighteen, so I went back but then I got married so I quit. And I didn't go back until later on, after the kids were, my youngest daughter was about five years old, and I went back to Bates. And from then on a lot of times I was laid off, because they didn't have much work. But then they'd call me back, I'd go back. And then I, after the kids were born I didn't work for a while. Then in 1971 I went back to Bates, worked in the yarn department.

       "29 Okay, spoolers are like you have to feed the machine, a long machine, you have to feed them, put in the bobbins and put up the threads so that when the machine passes by it picks up the threads and hooks it up onto, they call it a cheese, and it's on a drum so they wind around and they make a big cheese. Once that's full, when the machine goes back by, that cheese stays down so you have to take it off and put on a new starter. So that was the spoolers. And unicorners, well it was almost the same thing, they made cheeses also, but it was a lower machine and not as long. You just fed the like bobbins around and that would pick up, too, and make the same things, like cheeses. So that was what I did when I went back. And then I, they laid me off again after, well I worked in that department for probably close to eleven years, then I was laid off and I went to the sample department, worked there for a little while. 2 Then I put my name to work in the finishing room, and I got a job in the finishing room. So I worked there for quite a while, too. Then I was laid off, kept laying me off and the work was getting slower, so then they'd send me to the weave room, I worked in the weave room for a little while and then they called me back on my job in the yarn, not the yarn department but the finishing department, so I'd go back down there and then they laid me off again. So then one of the bosses, Mr. Provencer in the weave room saw my name on the list of laid offs and said, I want her to come back to work for me. So I went back in the weave room and worked there for seven months making the heads, putting up strings for the heads of the patterns, the patterns, the designs come through, so I worked there for seven years, sweating.                                                                                                                          \n",
       "31 Oh well, it was not that it, it was kind of hard but it was hot in the weave room, and it's, they needed that steam so in the summer you were sweating. And you had to tie those strings, you had to string them all up and then tie, when they hung down you had to put on the little gadgets that they had and you had to tie that in a knot. And then it took almost over a month or so to make one head, so it was a long process. And then after the knot you'd have to tie them with pliers and pull, make them tight, tight, and then you'd have to shellac them so they wouldn't slip off of the, while they were going up and down making the pattern. So then after that, well, they laid me off down there, too, because it was getting slow, so they sent me to the office and I worked in the office for, on the switchboard, for maybe three months. And then the girl that I was replacing came back, because her husband passed away, so I was laid off again. But then they called me back in to work in the office on orders, taking orders, you know, on the computer. But that didn't last too long either because then the Chinese were involved in there then, and so they decided to move all the office work to the Minnette Mills in North Carolina. So then I was laid off again. So then they sent me, they asked me if I would want to go to work at the store, or else be laid off, so I said I'll go to work at the store as a telemarketing, you know, and so I'd have to call in like motels and all that to see if they wanted bedspreads, and I did that for quite a while. And then in the meantime they asked me to work in the store also at the same time when they needed somebody in the store to help them out, so I'd do that and work in the office and the store also at the same time. And so I was there for thirteen years, in the store, until I retired four years ago. So that was about it.\n",

       "61 Well, yeah, and the, in the finishing room I, the first time I saw the finishing room I couldn't believe that, because I was working the sample department and the lady brought me into the finishing room and we just stood above them on like a little balcony like, and I can't believe, I've never seen so many women working in one room all together. You could see the whole finishing room, you know, stitchers and folders and all that. I couldn't believe how many people were in that room. But then I went to work in the finishing room after that, and I got friendly with most of those women. And I'm still friends with some of them today.

       "65 Well, my friend and I played some pranks, but I don't think I'd want to say them. Well, you know, once there, we were just sixteen years old then, and there was this man, well we tried to get this man and this lady together, and we'd tell her that he was interested in him [sic] and we'd tell him that she was interested in him, trying to get them together. And one, I don't know if they ever did, but anyways one time this man was always wearing the same clothes, and they were kind of filthy, so my friend and I, well let's get him, have him change those clothes. So my friend was talking to him while I was spraying him with oil, we were spraying him with oil, I was spraying him with oil, and then when he noticed what we were doing, he was so upset. And I said, well, have them cleaned and I'll pay for it. That's about all, is that one thing that I remember that we were pretty bad.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "67 My aunt, my aunt Jane. She worked on third shift, and when I went to work, to work there at Bates in the spooling department, she's the one that trained me on the spoolers. And we worked on third shift, which was very hard, you know, you're always sleepy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "69 Yes, eleven to seven was third shift. And so every time it came like six o'clock in the morning she'd really be tired and wanting to sleep. And on the spoolers, you know, you have to keep feeding this machine, because when it goes around if there's no thread in, you know, no bobbins and threads hanging up there for it to pick up, then all the cheeses come back down and it makes them soft, and they didn't like that. So, you know, you had to try to fill up that machine. I can't remember how many bobbins you have to put in before it came around, must have been three hundred and something bobbins that you had to do. And if you had a bad bobbin that was, you know, bad that you couldn't pull it out fast, you were having a hard time and you had to have that machine filled before it goes by. So plenty of times we couldn't fill it, we didn't have time, the machine would go by and -. Anyways, when it would stop on the end for not too long, then you'd try to pick up but then sometimes you still, if you had like I say bad bobbins and if you were slow, well of course the machine went by and you had, didn't have time to fill it. Anyways, one time my aunt was like, you know, was kind of getting tired and she was sleeping standing up, and she was still working, she was still putting on thread but she was sleeping, just standing there. And I happened to look at her and I said, oh, my goodness, I'd better go wake her up. So I went 5 over and I told, kind of, not to scare her, and I told her, I said, woke her up, and she didn't know, she didn't realize that she was doing that. But just standing there, and she was still working but nothing was happening. So, and the boss came around the corner at the same time when she finally woke up. So, you know, at that time, in the morning like that, like six o'clock there, you'd start getting tired and sleepy.         \n",
       "71 No, no, we had to plan it, plan a kind of plan, you know, that, like when he was on second, I was on third, so we'd have, when I'd leave for work before he came home, he'd be on second, I'd just have somebody kind of, the neighbors, you know, kind of keep, just keep an eye for five, ten minutes before he would come home. And that's the way we had it. When he went on first and I was still on third, so the kids were in school then so it wasn't as bad. And I'd come home and go to bed, and when they came back from school, well, I was home, you know. So, in the summer, well he was home during the day, so if I was on second or third, well he'd watch the kids, and we had to plan it that way. Plenty of times, too, when he was on second and I was on third, and you know, you get tired at night so you go to bed and try to sleep a couple of hours before you go to work. And the girls, well, I'd say okay, you can watch t.v. but you go to bed by eight o'clock, or whatever, you know. And they'd come, Mom, can we stay another hour, this show we want to watch. And I was so sleepy, okay. And plenty of times my husband would come in and I was still in bed and I didn't get up to go to work. Then I had to rush, really rush. And a lot of times, a couple of times it happened and then finally, well, I was on spooling then, so if you're not there when your, you know, when you start, your work is starting, like eleven o'clock you're not there, they have to strip that machine, that side of the machine because all the cheese would fall back down because there's nothing to tie them. So they'd take them all down, so then I'd come in fifteen minutes late. They didn't like that too much, they'd have to put them all back in. So anyway, I did that maybe, maybe three times. The third time the boss said, don't you have an alarm clock? That was the last time I was late.      \n",
       "73 I can't really think of anything. I just remember when I first started working at Bates, sixteen years old, you were wearing dresses then. And, you know, today you wear slacks or jeans or whatever, so that was a different time there, because everybody had dresses on. And in the morning the older ladies would go and, where their lockers were, whatever, and they'd change right in front of you. Took off their dresses and you'd see them in slips. That was different than it is later on, it was different because then you'd wear a pair of jeans or slacks and you'd keep them on to go home. It wasn't like it was in those days. And then a lot of times, too, you couldn't wear, you couldn't wear open shoes because of the risk of hurting yourself. You'd have to wear shoes that were harder a little bit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "75 Well, I remember one that happened when I was on the spoolers in the yarn department. Well, one girl was working on another machine, I can't recall the name of it, but she had her finger cut off. So they rushed her to the hospital I guess, and then somebody else, somebody came and looked for the rest of the finger, and they found it and they passed in back of me with a finger, I almost passed out. So that 6 was one thing that I remember of an accident. In another, well myself, when I was spooling and the bobbins got stuck sometimes on the strap, so I had gone, put my hand in there to kind of loosen them up, and one of them came up and caught my finger there and I couldn't get it out. So of course they came and shut the machine, and then that was really cut and it was really hurting, that was on third shift, so the boss brought me down to the nurse's station and there was nobody there because it was third shift. So he called the doctor and the doctor came down. I was laying down, but the boss was walking around and walking around, he was all white and nervous. And anyways, the doctor came and stitched it. And the next day when I went back to see the nurse, she opened that up, I almost passed out. I said, please, let me lay down. So, it was all pussey and, yeah, so that's another thing that happened.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

       "79 A lot of pictures that I was talking about that we had seen then and we took a few copies of them, that I asked somebody else where they were and they didn't know. So I don't know if, where they ended up. I don't know, because there were some that the workers were in overalls, like, you know, they were down in the, building the canal. When I get those back, I'll bring them to Rachel, to have her look at them and take copies, whatever.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

I learned a lot of jobs over there. Then it got slow at the Maine Shoe, there wasn 't enough, things didn't look good, so I went to Clark Shoe and I got a job there. That's where I married, I worked for my boss, I married him, and I worked there for a couple, three years, then we got married and I stopped working, because I was having my kids, you know, for five years. And then I went back for a little while, and then I heard about Falcon Shoe coming to Lewiston, and where I was working at Belgrade, before that, well when I quit at Clark I went to Belgrade Shoe, and it was quite a ways, you know, for the winter, to travel about seven miles, way up on Old Hotel Road . So I heard about Falcon shoe and I went and I got the job. I started with them , in '63 they opened up, and it was about the month of November when I worked there, but they weren't in full operation til after January 1st, but I helped to line up my packing room, finishing room and packing , because that's where I always worked.                                                                                                                                                    </td></tr>\n",

From the lasting room , they came out to me, last pullers, and I had girls who were cleaning the shoes, putting a dressing on it. First of all they put a sock line inside, you know, it was a process of finishing and making them look good. I had somebody to put a spray over them , shine them up. After that, well we had the repairers who touched up here and there, that was done along the way, and then I had some girls to pack them, pair them up and put them in the boxes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              </td></tr>\n",

I was working for twenty-five cents an hour until the NRA came in. We had the NRA parade, and I remember looking by the windows, we could see them parade on Court Street. And they passed the law of seventy-five cents for minimum. And gradually it went up, you know, but working for twenty five cents an hour, you know, it didn't give me my twelve-fifty. But in those days, in 1940, 1942, it was a lot of money for us. My mother worked at the mill and she only made fourteen- fifty a week. I had to go help her, and I learned every job along the way. From two, three different shoe factories, I learned different jobs, and when I went to Clark, I knew every job in the finishing and packing. But he needed a packer, so that's where I learned how to pair up the shoes, match them up, size them and pack them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    </td></tr>\n",

It was all sandals, and we made zebra, satin, leather, patent leather, all kinds of different sandals we made over there. They were beautiful shoes. When I was at Maine Shoe, we made nurses shoes, and regular lacing shoes. Different places had different style of shoes. When I went to Falcon, they were making, well they started on men's shoes that they brought in from Brockton, when Ted came, and he was with Bruce Hanley and they opened up Falcon Shoe on the fourth floor. So there wasn't many people, there was only one cutter and four, five stitchers, and they were starting to learn how to put them on the lath, how to make the shoes. But by January it started in full production. I got a little more people. new a lot of people in Lewiston and Auburn, having worked for so many years, that I brought in a lot of people to get things rolling . And gradually we had a second line, so they made the men's shoes and we made the child ren's shoes. So I ended up that by the time I retired, I had about forty, forty-five people working, I had two lines and, you know.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   </td></tr>\n",

And the reason I didn't want to go back there is because a lot of people resented me, you know, they thought I was telling on them, what was going on, because there's always somebody goofing off. So I got to the point, I didn't want to, I said , I'm not going back to work for you , I'll look somewhere else. And that's how come I ended at Belgrade. I was a packer at Belgrade, then I became a foreman over there. I worked there thirteen years, and then I came to Lewiston to work, be closer to home and tess traveling. So I really enjoyed better. The reason I stopped is because of my legs, my veins were hurting me so bad, my legs used to swell up and I couldn't sleep at night. My husband had passed away, but I toughed it out til sixty, and I decided I was better off to retire and take care of my legs. That's all.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    </td></tr>\n",

They were always in good production, Falcon Shoe. But like at Maine Shoe, they were good for two seasons, and then it would be slow, and I was laid off, and I went to work a little bit at Lombard Watson. I hated it, I worked only about a month, and when my boss called me I went back. Where I worked, from Belgrade, at Clark Shoe they never laid off anybody. It was slow, sometimes they'd work half a day for a few weeks and then it would pick up again, the orders would come in and it would pick up. But this never happened at Falcon, I'll tell you, we were always very busy, yeah, it was a good place, and I got to meet Ted 's father, Elmer, and his uncle Roy. They came in from Brockton and walked around in the factory and checked out the shoes. They were pretty happy about what we were doing. We made kid's shoes for Lamey Wellehan, and different other companies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     </td></tr>\n",

I can 't think much of anything different. I retired in '83, and then I kind of lost track of what was going on, and then the shoes started to move abroad . But I think Falcon Shoe is very good that they lasted this long and they're still, and we made boots too, you know, but they were not the kind of boots, now they're making waterproof and fireproof boots, but we made regular walking boots. They could work with them. And we used to, the kind of leather that we had was a little blah, you know, so we would have some wax that we put on a brush , and brush them and give them a texture. And there wasn't much to do the boots, just a sock lining and a little repairing and touching up here and there, for scratches or something, and then we'd polish them and they were ready for the packers. (Pause in taping) In the stitching room , after, well I guess it's been about, well, longer than I'm saying now, but when I was working there, they had these new machines that, they would emboss the vamp and make it look like the stitching, and it was a lot of time saver. They would just the cutters would cut the vamps, they would give them to this machine, have somebody, and they would just make little perforation on it, or stitching. It eliminated quite a few people, but it was fast production.                                                                </td></tr>\n",

See, the front of the shoe, that's a vamp. Like, well not these, but you know, they go around here. And then there's a back, that's before it goes to the lasting room . So when it goes to the lasting room, they're put on a last, they call them the last puller, and they put them on the last, and it goes around, they're cemented in the bottom . And it goes, it starts with a counter, they put a counter in the back of the shoe, and then it's on the last, and then it goes around, and then it's on the sole layer. It goes around on a conveyor. We had the conveyor in the lasting room. We didn't have it everywhere, but I had , finally, after awhile, they extended the conveyor in my room, you know, where they came, the last puller will take the shoe off and put them on a board, like three pairs, and pass it on, and the girl would put a sock line in there, and pass it on . It kept moving like this, board after board . Sometimes it went fast and we got overloaded, the girls sometimes couldn't keep on , so I would add another girl to clean it up. Because I had a girl, an all-around girl, who would, the cases are sometimes short. If they break something, they don't finish, we have to have it re-cut, so when they pack them, they leave the papers out, and when the shoes come around we finish them and put them where they belong, you know, to try to fill up the case. So, that's what it was.</td></tr>\n",

I learned a lot of jobs over there. Then it got slow at the Maine Shoe, there wasn 't enough, things didn't look good, so I went to Clark Shoe and I got a job there. That's where I married, I worked for my boss, I married him, and I worked there for a couple, three years, then we got married and I stopped working, because I was having my kids, you know, for five years. And then I went back for a little while, and then I heard about Falcon Shoe coming to Lewiston, and where I was working at Belgrade, before that, well when I quit at Clark I went to Belgrade Shoe, and it was quite a ways, you know, for the winter, to travel about seven miles, way up on Old Hotel Road . So I heard about Falcon shoe and I went and I got the job. I started with them , in '63 they opened up, and it was about the month of November when I worked there, but they weren't in full operation til after January 1st, but I helped to line up my packing room, finishing room and packing , because that's where I always worked.                                                                                                                                                    \\\\\n",

From the lasting room , they came out to me, last pullers, and I had girls who were cleaning the shoes, putting a dressing on it. First of all they put a sock line inside, you know, it was a process of finishing and making them look good. I had somebody to put a spray over them , shine them up. After that, well we had the repairers who touched up here and there, that was done along the way, and then I had some girls to pack them, pair them up and put them in the boxes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \\\\\n",

I was working for twenty-five cents an hour until the NRA came in. We had the NRA parade, and I remember looking by the windows, we could see them parade on Court Street. And they passed the law of seventy-five cents for minimum. And gradually it went up, you know, but working for twenty five cents an hour, you know, it didn't give me my twelve-fifty. But in those days, in 1940, 1942, it was a lot of money for us. My mother worked at the mill and she only made fourteen- fifty a week. I had to go help her, and I learned every job along the way. From two, three different shoe factories, I learned different jobs, and when I went to Clark, I knew every job in the finishing and packing. But he needed a packer, so that's where I learned how to pair up the shoes, match them up, size them and pack them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \\\\\n",

It was all sandals, and we made zebra, satin, leather, patent leather, all kinds of different sandals we made over there. They were beautiful shoes. When I was at Maine Shoe, we made nurses shoes, and regular lacing shoes. Different places had different style of shoes. When I went to Falcon, they were making, well they started on men's shoes that they brought in from Brockton, when Ted came, and he was with Bruce Hanley and they opened up Falcon Shoe on the fourth floor. So there wasn't many people, there was only one cutter and four, five stitchers, and they were starting to learn how to put them on the lath, how to make the shoes. But by January it started in full production. I got a little more people. new a lot of people in Lewiston and Auburn, having worked for so many years, that I brought in a lot of people to get things rolling . And gradually we had a second line, so they made the men's shoes and we made the child ren's shoes. So I ended up that by the time I retired, I had about forty, forty-five people working, I had two lines and, you know.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \\\\\n",

They're very tough to work for. But Falcon Shoe came in and started, and from the beginning they were wonderful. They were good to the people and they paid well. Of course we didn't have the union, and they didn't want that, so they always paid a little better than the union would allow the other. So they were very, very nice people to work for. I really enjoyed there, I worked their for twenty years and it was great, it was very nice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \\\\\n",

We had very good help and they were steady, you could depend on them , you know.

And the reason I didn't want to go back there is because a lot of people resented me, you know, they thought I was telling on them, what was going on, because there's always somebody goofing off. So I got to the point, I didn't want to, I said , I'm not going back to work for you , I'll look somewhere else. And that's how come I ended at Belgrade. I was a packer at Belgrade, then I became a foreman over there. I worked there thirteen years, and then I came to Lewiston to work, be closer to home and tess traveling. So I really enjoyed better. The reason I stopped is because of my legs, my veins were hurting me so bad, my legs used to swell up and I couldn't sleep at night. My husband had passed away, but I toughed it out til sixty, and I decided I was better off to retire and take care of my legs. That's all.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \\\\\n",

They were always in good production, Falcon Shoe. But like at Maine Shoe, they were good for two seasons, and then it would be slow, and I was laid off, and I went to work a little bit at Lombard Watson. I hated it, I worked only about a month, and when my boss called me I went back. Where I worked, from Belgrade, at Clark Shoe they never laid off anybody. It was slow, sometimes they'd work half a day for a few weeks and then it would pick up again, the orders would come in and it would pick up. But this never happened at Falcon, I'll tell you, we were always very busy, yeah, it was a good place, and I got to meet Ted 's father, Elmer, and his uncle Roy. They came in from Brockton and walked around in the factory and checked out the shoes. They were pretty happy about what we were doing. We made kid's shoes for Lamey Wellehan, and different other companies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \\\\\n",

They would have ordered like so many pairs, and they were in corrugators for thirty six pairs. So we would have quite a few, let's say like one order was four, then we had another order with the same company, and we made shoes for, you know, it's been a long time and I can 't remember all the people. I know we made shoes for Cole a long time ago. But we always were busy. It was great.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \\\\\n",

They had to stay at their place, and they would talk with the next one to them and all that, you know. But the production kept pushing. They had to keep up with the production. And sometimes the shoes were not like it should have been, so we would have a back up, you know, but they would be very good and end up by cleaning it all up.

And it passed. The people voted on it, I guess, I can't remember. But anyway, from twenty- five cents we jumped to seventy-five, plus a little more, a dollar twenty-five, and slowly, every year, slowly the minimum went up. Just like now, I think it's up to five, seventy- five, the minimum, I'm not sure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \\\\\n",

I can 't think much of anything different. I retired in '83, and then I kind of lost track of what was going on, and then the shoes started to move abroad . But I think Falcon Shoe is very good that they lasted this long and they're still, and we made boots too, you know, but they were not the kind of boots, now they're making waterproof and fireproof boots, but we made regular walking boots. They could work with them. And we used to, the kind of leather that we had was a little blah, you know, so we would have some wax that we put on a brush , and brush them and give them a texture. And there wasn't much to do the boots, just a sock lining and a little repairing and touching up here and there, for scratches or something, and then we'd polish them and they were ready for the packers. (Pause in taping) In the stitching room , after, well I guess it's been about, well, longer than I'm saying now, but when I was working there, they had these new machines that, they would emboss the vamp and make it look like the stitching, and it was a lot of time saver. They would just the cutters would cut the vamps, they would give them to this machine, have somebody, and they would just make little perforation on it, or stitching. It eliminated quite a few people, but it was fast production.                                                                \\\\\n",

See, the front of the shoe, that's a vamp. Like, well not these, but you know, they go around here. And then there's a back, that's before it goes to the lasting room . So when it goes to the lasting room, they're put on a last, they call them the last puller, and they put them on the last, and it goes around, they're cemented in the bottom . And it goes, it starts with a counter, they put a counter in the back of the shoe, and then it's on the last, and then it goes around, and then it's on the sole layer. It goes around on a conveyor. We had the conveyor in the lasting room. We didn't have it everywhere, but I had , finally, after awhile, they extended the conveyor in my room, you know, where they came, the last puller will take the shoe off and put them on a board, like three pairs, and pass it on, and the girl would put a sock line in there, and pass it on . It kept moving like this, board after board . Sometimes it went fast and we got overloaded, the girls sometimes couldn't keep on , so I would add another girl to clean it up. Because I had a girl, an all-around girl, who would, the cases are sometimes short. If they break something, they don't finish, we have to have it re-cut, so when they pack them, they leave the papers out, and when the shoes come around we finish them and put them where they belong, you know, to try to fill up the case. So, that's what it was.\\\\\n",

I learned a lot of jobs over there. Then it got slow at the Maine Shoe, there wasn 't enough, things didn't look good, so I went to Clark Shoe and I got a job there. That's where I married, I worked for my boss, I married him, and I worked there for a couple, three years, then we got married and I stopped working, because I was having my kids, you know, for five years. And then I went back for a little while, and then I heard about Falcon Shoe coming to Lewiston, and where I was working at Belgrade, before that, well when I quit at Clark I went to Belgrade Shoe, and it was quite a ways, you know, for the winter, to travel about seven miles, way up on Old Hotel Road . So I heard about Falcon shoe and I went and I got the job. I started with them , in '63 they opened up, and it was about the month of November when I worked there, but they weren't in full operation til after January 1st, but I helped to line up my packing room, finishing room and packing , because that's where I always worked.                                                                                                                                                     | \n",

From the lasting room , they came out to me, last pullers, and I had girls who were cleaning the shoes, putting a dressing on it. First of all they put a sock line inside, you know, it was a process of finishing and making them look good. I had somebody to put a spray over them , shine them up. After that, well we had the repairers who touched up here and there, that was done along the way, and then I had some girls to pack them, pair them up and put them in the boxes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | \n",

I was working for twenty-five cents an hour until the NRA came in. We had the NRA parade, and I remember looking by the windows, we could see them parade on Court Street. And they passed the law of seventy-five cents for minimum. And gradually it went up, you know, but working for twenty five cents an hour, you know, it didn't give me my twelve-fifty. But in those days, in 1940, 1942, it was a lot of money for us. My mother worked at the mill and she only made fourteen- fifty a week. I had to go help her, and I learned every job along the way. From two, three different shoe factories, I learned different jobs, and when I went to Clark, I knew every job in the finishing and packing. But he needed a packer, so that's where I learned how to pair up the shoes, match them up, size them and pack them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | \n",

It was all sandals, and we made zebra, satin, leather, patent leather, all kinds of different sandals we made over there. They were beautiful shoes. When I was at Maine Shoe, we made nurses shoes, and regular lacing shoes. Different places had different style of shoes. When I went to Falcon, they were making, well they started on men's shoes that they brought in from Brockton, when Ted came, and he was with Bruce Hanley and they opened up Falcon Shoe on the fourth floor. So there wasn't many people, there was only one cutter and four, five stitchers, and they were starting to learn how to put them on the lath, how to make the shoes. But by January it started in full production. I got a little more people. new a lot of people in Lewiston and Auburn, having worked for so many years, that I brought in a lot of people to get things rolling . And gradually we had a second line, so they made the men's shoes and we made the child ren's shoes. So I ended up that by the time I retired, I had about forty, forty-five people working, I had two lines and, you know.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | \n",

They're very tough to work for. But Falcon Shoe came in and started, and from the beginning they were wonderful. They were good to the people and they paid well. Of course we didn't have the union, and they didn't want that, so they always paid a little better than the union would allow the other. So they were very, very nice people to work for. I really enjoyed there, I worked their for twenty years and it was great, it was very nice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | \n",

But at Falcons, a good worker would last quite a while. And really, the young girls that had never worked before, well they didn't stay very long. But we managed to get good help. We had very good help and they were steady, you could depend on them , you know. And as the years went on, we had a dinner meeting at Falcon Shoe, and we had share of profit, every meeting we had a share of the three months, you know, and very good bonuses, very well paid .

And the reason I didn't want to go back there is because a lot of people resented me, you know, they thought I was telling on them, what was going on, because there's always somebody goofing off. So I got to the point, I didn't want to, I said , I'm not going back to work for you , I'll look somewhere else. And that's how come I ended at Belgrade. I was a packer at Belgrade, then I became a foreman over there. I worked there thirteen years, and then I came to Lewiston to work, be closer to home and tess traveling. So I really enjoyed better. The reason I stopped is because of my legs, my veins were hurting me so bad, my legs used to swell up and I couldn't sleep at night. My husband had passed away, but I toughed it out til sixty, and I decided I was better off to retire and take care of my legs. That's all.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | \n",

They were always in good production, Falcon Shoe. But like at Maine Shoe, they were good for two seasons, and then it would be slow, and I was laid off, and I went to work a little bit at Lombard Watson. I hated it, I worked only about a month, and when my boss called me I went back. Where I worked, from Belgrade, at Clark Shoe they never laid off anybody. It was slow, sometimes they'd work half a day for a few weeks and then it would pick up again, the orders would come in and it would pick up. But this never happened at Falcon, I'll tell you, we were always very busy, yeah, it was a good place, and I got to meet Ted 's father, Elmer, and his uncle Roy. They came in from Brockton and walked around in the factory and checked out the shoes. They were pretty happy about what we were doing. We made kid's shoes for Lamey Wellehan, and different other companies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | \n",

They would have ordered like so many pairs, and they were in corrugators for thirty six pairs. So we would have quite a few, let's say like one order was four, then we had another order with the same company, and we made shoes for, you know, it's been a long time and I can 't remember all the people. I know we made shoes for Cole a long time ago. But we always were busy.

But anyway, from twenty- five cents we jumped to seventy-five, plus a little more, a dollar twenty-five, and slowly, every year, slowly the minimum went up. Just like now, I think it's up to five, seventy- five, the minimum, I'm not sure.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | \n",

I can 't think much of anything different. I retired in '83, and then I kind of lost track of what was going on, and then the shoes started to move abroad . But I think Falcon Shoe is very good that they lasted this long and they're still, and we made boots too, you know, but they were not the kind of boots, now they're making waterproof and fireproof boots, but we made regular walking boots. They could work with them. And we used to, the kind of leather that we had was a little blah, you know, so we would have some wax that we put on a brush , and brush them and give them a texture. And there wasn't much to do the boots, just a sock lining and a little repairing and touching up here and there, for scratches or something, and then we'd polish them and they were ready for the packers. (Pause in taping) In the stitching room , after, well I guess it's been about, well, longer than I'm saying now, but when I was working there, they had these new machines that, they would emboss the vamp and make it look like the stitching, and it was a lot of time saver. They would just the cutters would cut the vamps, they would give them to this machine, have somebody, and they would just make little perforation on it, or stitching. It eliminated quite a few people, but it was fast production.                                                                 | \n",

See, the front of the shoe, that's a vamp. Like, well not these, but you know, they go around here. And then there's a back, that's before it goes to the lasting room . So when it goes to the lasting room, they're put on a last, they call them the last puller, and they put them on the last, and it goes around, they're cemented in the bottom . And it goes, it starts with a counter, they put a counter in the back of the shoe, and then it's on the last, and then it goes around, and then it's on the sole layer. It goes around on a conveyor. We had the conveyor in the lasting room. We didn't have it everywhere, but I had , finally, after awhile, they extended the conveyor in my room, you know, where they came, the last puller will take the shoe off and put them on a board, like three pairs, and pass it on, and the girl would put a sock line in there, and pass it on . It kept moving like this, board after board . Sometimes it went fast and we got overloaded, the girls sometimes couldn't keep on , so I would add another girl to clean it up. Because I had a girl, an all-around girl, who would, the cases are sometimes short. If they break something, they don't finish, we have to have it re-cut, so when they pack them, they leave the papers out, and when the shoes come around we finish them and put them where they belong, you know, to try to fill up the case. So, that's what it was. | \n",

I learned a lot of jobs over there. Then it got slow at the Maine Shoe, there wasn 't enough, things didn't look good, so I went to Clark Shoe and I got a job there. That's where I married, I worked for my boss, I married him, and I worked there for a couple, three years, then we got married and I stopped working, because I was having my kids, you know, for five years. And then I went back for a little while, and then I heard about Falcon Shoe coming to Lewiston, and where I was working at Belgrade, before that, well when I quit at Clark I went to Belgrade Shoe, and it was quite a ways, you know, for the winter, to travel about seven miles, way up on Old Hotel Road . So I heard about Falcon shoe and I went and I got the job. I started with them , in '63 they opened up, and it was about the month of November when I worked there, but they weren't in full operation til after January 1st, but I helped to line up my packing room, finishing room and packing , because that's where I always worked.                                                                                                                                                    \n",

From the lasting room , they came out to me, last pullers, and I had girls who were cleaning the shoes, putting a dressing on it. First of all they put a sock line inside, you know, it was a process of finishing and making them look good. I had somebody to put a spray over them , shine them up. After that, well we had the repairers who touched up here and there, that was done along the way, and then I had some girls to pack them, pair them up and put them in the boxes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

And they passed the law of seventy-five cents for minimum. And gradually it went up, you know, but working for twenty five cents an hour, you know, it didn't give me my twelve-fifty. But in those days, in 1940, 1942, it was a lot of money for us. My mother worked at the mill and she only made fourteen- fifty a week. I had to go help her, and I learned every job along the way. From two, three different shoe factories, I learned different jobs, and when I went to Clark, I knew every job in the finishing and packing. But he needed a packer, so that's where I learned how to pair up the shoes, match them up, size them and pack them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

       "14 Well at Clark Shoe, it was a novelty shoe. It was all sandals, and we made zebra, satin, leather, patent leather, all kinds of different sandals we made over there. They were beautiful shoes. When I was at Maine Shoe, we made nurses shoes, and regular lacing shoes. Different places had different style of shoes. When I went to Falcon, they were making, well they started on men's shoes that they brought in from Brockton, when Ted came, and he was with Bruce Hanley and they opened up Falcon Shoe on the fourth floor. So there wasn't many people, there was only one cutter and four, five stitchers, and they were starting to learn how to put them on the lath, how to make the shoes. But by January it started in full production. I got a little more people. new a lot of people in Lewiston and Auburn, having worked for so many years, that I brought in a lot of people to get things rolling . And gradually we had a second line, so they made the men's shoes and we made the child ren's shoes. So I ended up that by the time I retired, I had about forty, forty-five people working, I had two lines and, you know.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "16 Yes, I know, different places is right. They're very tough to work for. But Falcon Shoe came in and started, and from the beginning they were wonderful. They were good to the people and they paid well. Of course we didn't have the union, and they didn't want that, so they always paid a little better than the union would allow the other. So they were very, very nice people to work for.

       "22 He was a foreman for thirty years with Clark Shoe. And the reason I didn't want to go back there is because a lot of people resented me, you know, they thought I was telling on them, what was going on, because there's always somebody goofing off. So I got to the point, I didn't want to, I said , I'm not going back to work for you , I'll look somewhere else. And that's how come I ended at Belgrade. I was a packer at Belgrade, then I became a foreman over there. I worked there thirteen years, and then I came to Lewiston to work, be closer to home and tess traveling. So I really enjoyed better. The reason I stopped is because of my legs, my veins were hurting me so bad, my legs used to swell up and I couldn't sleep at night. My husband had passed away, but I toughed it out til sixty, and I decided I was better off to retire and take care of my legs.

       "24 No, no, not us. They were always in good production, Falcon Shoe. But like at Maine Shoe, they were good for two seasons, and then it would be slow, and I was laid off, and I went to work a little bit at Lombard Watson. I hated it, I worked only about a month, and when my boss called me I went back. Where I worked, from Belgrade, at Clark Shoe they never laid off anybody. It was slow, sometimes they'd work half a day for a few weeks and then it would pick up again, the orders would come in and it would pick up. But this never happened at Falcon, I'll tell you, we were always very busy, yeah, it was a good place, and I got to meet Ted 's father, Elmer, and his uncle Roy. They came in from Brockton and walked around in the factory and checked out the shoes. They were pretty happy about what we were doing. We made kid's shoes for Lamey Wellehan, and different other companies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "26 Oh, they were already ordered. They would have ordered like so many pairs, and they were in corrugators for thirty six pairs. So we would have quite a few, let's say like one order was four, then we had another order with the same company, and we made shoes for, you know, it's been a long time and I can 't remember all the people.

But the production kept pushing. They had to keep up with the production.

       "30 It was a group of people that got together, and there was a band, and there were like demonstrations, you know, walking down the street, to increase the wages. And it passed. The people voted on it, I guess, I can't remember. But anyway, from twenty- five cents we jumped to seventy-five, plus a little more, a dollar twenty-five, and slowly, every year, slowly the minimum went up.

       "44 No, I think I've covered about everything that happened . I can 't think much of anything different. I retired in '83, and then I kind of lost track of what was going on, and then the shoes started to move abroad . But I think Falcon Shoe is very good that they lasted this long and they're still, and we made boots too, you know, but they were not the kind of boots, now they're making waterproof and fireproof boots, but we made regular walking boots. They could work with them. And we used to, the kind of leather that we had was a little blah, you know, so we would have some wax that we put on a brush , and brush them and give them a texture. And there wasn't much to do the boots, just a sock lining and a little repairing and touching up here and there, for scratches or something, and then we'd polish them and they were ready for the packers. (Pause in taping) In the stitching room , after, well I guess it's been about, well, longer than I'm saying now, but when I was working there, they had these new machines that, they would emboss the vamp and make it look like the stitching, and it was a lot of time saver. They would just the cutters would cut the vamps, they would give them to this machine, have somebody, and they would just make little perforation on it, or stitching. It eliminated quite a few people, but it was fast production.                                                                \n",
       "46 The front of the shoe. See, the front of the shoe, that's a vamp. Like, well not these, but you know, they go around here. And then there's a back, that's before it goes to the lasting room . So when it goes to the lasting room, they're put on a last, they call them the last puller, and they put them on the last, and it goes around, they're cemented in the bottom . And it goes, it starts with a counter, they put a counter in the back of the shoe, and then it's on the last, and then it goes around, and then it's on the sole layer. It goes around on a conveyor. We had the conveyor in the lasting room. We didn't have it everywhere, but I had , finally, after awhile, they extended the conveyor in my room, you know, where they came, the last puller will take the shoe off and put them on a board, like three pairs, and pass it on, and the girl would put a sock line in there, and pass it on . It kept moving like this, board after board . Sometimes it went fast and we got overloaded, the girls sometimes couldn't keep on , so I would add another girl to clean it up. Because I had a girl, an all-around girl, who would, the cases are sometimes short. If they break something, they don't finish, we have to have it re-cut, so when they pack them, they leave the papers out, and when the shoes come around we finish them and put them where they belong, you know, to try to fill up the case. So, that's what it was."

She worked in the mill during the war, on a so-called victory shift, it was a partial second shift. I don’t know, I, if I recall, I was going to high school at the time, and I’d come home and she’d get ready to go to work. My brothers were in the military, and it was, I don’t know, four, six hour shift, something like that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               </td></tr>\n",

You were close to your neighbors, you didn’t have, most people didn’t have a car, you walked. Didn’t take the bus too often. I don’t think we had busses, we had streetcars back then, and that was an experience. And, you know, people didn’t lock their doors, you just went in, in and out. And all the kids were happy. And we played outdoors, because, you know, no television. So we had a good upbringing. I went to, attended parochial school, and my brothers did, too, and that was pretty special. And it, it was easier, not as stressful as today. And everybody talked to everybody else, and it was, it was good. And you were poor, but you didn’t know you were poor, so you didn’t care. Didn’t make any difference. Everybody was the same, you know.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               </td></tr>\n",

And another thing, you had a, the refrigeration to keep your food was so-called ice box, so your mom had to provide continuous ice, you had to buy from the local ice man traveling up and down the street with his ice truck and buy a block of ice that would fit the ice box, so-called, and keep your food refrigerated. And one of the consequences I guess, the ice melts, and you have to have a bucket to pick up the water. And do not forget to empty the bucket, because it overflows on the kitchen floor, it ruins the ceiling for the tenant below you, and you’re in trouble. So we did our shopping right locally, and yes, it was fun. You’d walk up and down Lisbon Street like you do today in the mall. You had everything you wanted down there, you had your clothing stores, you had your hardware, you had barber shops, beauty shops, a few restaurants. And you could buy sewing needles to washing machines, whatever you needed, it was there. That’s why life was good, yeah. Didn’t have much money to spend, but it was okay. It was okay. We just managed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           </td></tr>\n",

We all spoke French, and then I learned English at the parochial school. It was St. Peter’s and Paul’s parochial school. And they just tore down that building there a few months ago, so that hurts. Because it was a lot of memories, and it was a nice, large building. I don’t know if you had a chance to see it. And we were, oh, six, four, five hundred kids. A lot, a lot of students there. And it was convenient. You didn’t have a cafeteria, you walked home for lunch, you walked home for lunch. So that took care of the day. You’d carry a big school bag with all your books, all your papers to do your homework at night, bring it back. And everybody was, well, was at the same level. By that I mean, we had a uniform. The girls wore a little black dress, usually with a little white collar, it was referred to as smock, and the moms sewed the little black uniforms and, in September, getting ready for a new school year, you outgrow them or you hand-me-down if you had a sister, the uniform would be handed down. So everybody looked alike, there was no, hey, what’s you wearing, you know, what are you going to wear tomorrow. Nothing, you just went to school and that was it. Of course we had nuns, the teachers were all nuns. And the school was divided, the girls would be taught by the nuns, the boys and girls up to I believe was grade four, five. I could be confused. Maybe it was grade f-. Anyway, at one point they separated, the boys went to one side of the building, a wing of the school, we went the, the girls went the other. But the boys, their teachers were male, they were from, well, I don’t want to say an organization but, it was the Brothers of the Sacred Heart that lived here in Lewiston that were teaching the boys. And the nuns were from the order of the Dominican nuns, they were teaching us, the girls. So it, it was interesting how things progressed as you got a little older.</td></tr>\n",

He was, well, he was referred to as an insurance agent. He worked for the Prudential Insurance Company that sold life insurance at that time, so he was going house to house, collecting insurance, imagine that, and selling policies, and doing that in the twin cities. So there was never a lack of income because of, you know, getting laid off or a company making a change, or the Depression. So we were fortunate that way.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           </td></tr>\n",

So I came across some information where they were looking for an office girl in the personnel office at the mill, and the salary was so much better than the State was at that time. At that time. So I went for an interview, and I was lucky to be hired, and I made the change.

So we had a good group, got along very well and did our best to, you know, provide for the people seeking employment and keeping them posted on job changes or whatever needed to be done.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   </td></tr>\n",

And there was a lot of typing, a lot of handwritten reports, and a lot of filing. Gee, there was a lot of filing. You see, the employees belonged to a labor organization, the Textile Workers Union, and that means that you have a lot to do with seniority and job posting.

Because during the war, they were fabricating cloth for the military, I believe. And that was over, and they were going into a new phase. They were doing a lot of, well, the bedspreads, which Bates is very well known for that, and they were also doing yard goods. And the yard goods were very special, because they had come out at the time, I don’t know if that was, well, invented, if the process was locally or not, but the fabric got the title of discipline, the word discipline meant it was virtually wrinkle free. And that was unheard of in those days, you didn’t have to iron. If you made a dress or whatever you used the yard goods for, it was a nice cotton and it was disciplined. And it was sold here locally at the, at a store called Center’s &amp; Giroux, they used to sell those yard goods, and the people benefited in the area from that.

We used to have as employees, as a group, Christmas parties. But see, by working in the personnel office, we were only four people. But the other office in the Bates Division, the main office where Arthur Ford I believe was the manager, oh, there must have been, I hope I’ve got the right, they were many there. I don’t know, I’ll say thirty, maybe thirty ladies working in that department.

And everybody knew, the telephone operator, Evelyn, knew everybody and everybody knew her. She was a great lady, and very, very nice, 4 very informative, and good sense of humor. And I remember the nurse, too, the, can’t tell you her name. Florence was it? I’m not sure. The Industrial nurse that took care of the people if you had a minor accident. So, and there was another gentleman, Freddie, Freddie Banks, he handled payroll in the office. Again, in the office outside of personnel. And he, he was an interesting little fella. We’d always ask, what would you do if you get held up? Oh, he says, I’d give them the money, I’d give them the money, we’re insured. In those days, you used, the gentleman would go to the bank, assisted by a lady, I can’t think of her name, and they’d put the cash, your pay, cash, in an envelope. There were no checks. It was cash.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     </td></tr>\n",

The, I don’t say the whole mill, I just know about the office people. And that got to be, you know, quite a bit of money, so they’d go to the bank and prepare that and bring it back, and then they’d come to your desk and hand you your envelope. But it was surprising, as you think of it today, to have all, go through all that cash, all the pennies in there and everything. So that was something you kind of remember. I enjoyed the time I spent there. I was quite young, and I had a family, and you did your work, the, you know, the best of your ability, you were proud, and you come home and took care of your family and next day went back to work. And also at that time, the week of the Fourth of July, the plant would close. And most other businesses in the twin city would close for the week. That was it, that was vacation week. Take it or leave it, that was vacation week. And, you know, the barbershop closed, a lot of the small mom and pop stores, and it was very quiet in town because everyone was on vacation. So, you know, everybody went out to the beach, and every place was very, you know, packed with people. It was fun, and you just took it for granted, that’s when you take your vacation, rain, shine or otherwise. And then all the machinery would stop, and then on the Monday you came back to work, everything had to be started up again. It was unique, you know, comparing it to today. Back then it was the going thing, you accepted it and that’s the way it was. But today, very different.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               </td></tr>\n",

After, I don’t know how long, I was transferred from the personnel office to the converting office. Now, converting was a small office where you prepared the paperwork for this line that I mentioned earlier of the yard goods. The yard goods had to be sent to Rhode Island to a dye house where they, you know, put in the colors or the prints and all that, and you had to figure how much, oh what did they call it, I can’t remember, of the raw product to finish the colors and the prints on the material. So I worked in that office, and at the time I left it was due to a pregnancy. And when I returned a few months later, the type of longhand work, the job I was doing, was practically eliminated. It wasn’t the beginning of computers, but it was a system, I’m trying to think of the word, it was like a punch card system of sorts.

Once in a while as part of my duties, I’ll mention that, at the personnel office, you had to put up notices about the jobs. And I would walk through that whole mill, which is a huge building, on different floors, and I used to staple the notices on the bulletin board. And I 5 was five feet one, one inch, so there were times when I need a little help to get up with my stapler and put the, put up the notices on the board. So it was a little bit of a challenge, which sometimes I didn’t care to do.

I was just, no, I don’t remember him doing that. However, before coming to Lewiston, to the mill town so-called, they lived in, my mother’s family lived in Canada, and my grandfather came to the United States to find employment.

She worked in the mill during the war, on a so-called victory shift, it was a partial second shift. I don’t know, I, if I recall, I was going to high school at the time, and I’d come home and she’d get ready to go to work. My brothers were in the military, and it was, I don’t know, four, six hour shift, something like that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \\\\\n",

You were close to your neighbors, you didn’t have, most people didn’t have a car, you walked. Didn’t take the bus too often. I don’t think we had busses, we had streetcars back then, and that was an experience. And, you know, people didn’t lock their doors, you just went in, in and out. And all the kids were happy. And we played outdoors, because, you know, no television. So we had a good upbringing. I went to, attended parochial school, and my brothers did, too, and that was pretty special. And it, it was easier, not as stressful as today. And everybody talked to everybody else, and it was, it was good. And you were poor, but you didn’t know you were poor, so you didn’t care. Didn’t make any difference. Everybody was the same, you know.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \\\\\n",

And another thing, you had a, the refrigeration to keep your food was so-called ice box, so your mom had to provide continuous ice, you had to buy from the local ice man traveling up and down the street with his ice truck and buy a block of ice that would fit the ice box, so-called, and keep your food refrigerated. And one of the consequences I guess, the ice melts, and you have to have a bucket to pick up the water. And do not forget to empty the bucket, because it overflows on the kitchen floor, it ruins the ceiling for the tenant below you, and you’re in trouble. So we did our shopping right locally, and yes, it was fun. You’d walk up and down Lisbon Street like you do today in the mall. You had everything you wanted down there, you had your clothing stores, you had your hardware, you had barber shops, beauty shops, a few restaurants. And you could buy sewing needles to washing machines, whatever you needed, it was there. That’s why life was good, yeah. Didn’t have much money to spend, but it was okay. It was okay. We just managed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \\\\\n",

We all spoke French, and then I learned English at the parochial school. It was St. Peter’s and Paul’s parochial school. And they just tore down that building there a few months ago, so that hurts. Because it was a lot of memories, and it was a nice, large building. I don’t know if you had a chance to see it. And we were, oh, six, four, five hundred kids. A lot, a lot of students there. And it was convenient. You didn’t have a cafeteria, you walked home for lunch, you walked home for lunch. So that took care of the day. You’d carry a big school bag with all your books, all your papers to do your homework at night, bring it back. And everybody was, well, was at the same level. By that I mean, we had a uniform. The girls wore a little black dress, usually with a little white collar, it was referred to as smock, and the moms sewed the little black uniforms and, in September, getting ready for a new school year, you outgrow them or you hand-me-down if you had a sister, the uniform would be handed down. So everybody looked alike, there was no, hey, what’s you wearing, you know, what are you going to wear tomorrow. Nothing, you just went to school and that was it. Of course we had nuns, the teachers were all nuns. And the school was divided, the girls would be taught by the nuns, the boys and girls up to I believe was grade four, five. I could be confused. Maybe it was grade f-. Anyway, at one point they separated, the boys went to one side of the building, a wing of the school, we went the, the girls went the other. But the boys, their teachers were male, they were from, well, I don’t want to say an organization but, it was the Brothers of the Sacred Heart that lived here in Lewiston that were teaching the boys. And the nuns were from the order of the Dominican nuns, they were teaching us, the girls. So it, it was interesting how things progressed as you got a little older.\\\\\n",

He was, well, he was referred to as an insurance agent. He worked for the Prudential Insurance Company that sold life insurance at that time, so he was going house to house, collecting insurance, imagine that, and selling policies, and doing that in the twin cities. So there was never a lack of income because of, you know, getting laid off or a company making a change, or the Depression. So we were fortunate that way.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \\\\\n",

So I came across some information where they were looking for an office girl in the personnel office at the mill, and the salary was so much better than the State was at that time. At that time. So I went for an interview, and I was lucky to be hired, and I made the change.

So we had a good group, got along very well and did our best to, you know, provide for the people seeking employment and keeping them posted on job changes or whatever needed to be done.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \\\\\n",

And there was a lot of typing, a lot of handwritten reports, and a lot of filing. Gee, there was a lot of filing. You see, the employees belonged to a labor organization, the Textile Workers Union, and that means that you have a lot to do with seniority and job posting. So the files were set up more or less according to that, so that besides being alphabetical by department by seniority, it involved a lot of details. So that made it interesting. 3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \\\\\n",

And I was, I was asked frequently enough to sit in and translate their version of their past history to the interviewer who was putting down that information.

Because during the war, they were fabricating cloth for the military, I believe. And that was over, and they were going into a new phase. They were doing a lot of, well, the bedspreads, which Bates is very well known for that, and they were also doing yard goods. And the yard goods were very special, because they had come out at the time, I don’t know if that was, well, invented, if the process was locally or not, but the fabric got the title of discipline, the word discipline meant it was virtually wrinkle free. And that was unheard of in those days, you didn’t have to iron. If you made a dress or whatever you used the yard goods for, it was a nice cotton and it was disciplined. And it was sold here locally at the, at a store called Center’s \\& Giroux, they used to sell those yard goods, and the people benefited in the area from that. So, found out that the, the company made money with that because it was first on the market.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \\\\\n",

But I knew that the Bates hockey team, they sponsored hockey and that was very, very popular in the area. I never did go to hockey games. I knew one of the players, and I also recall that the team went to Europe and they played in Europe, and they were very successful. I don’t know in what country, but. We used to have as employees, as a group, Christmas parties. But see, by working in the personnel office, we were only four people. But the other office in the Bates Division, the main office where Arthur Ford I believe was the manager, oh, there must have been, I hope I’ve got the right, they were many there. I don’t know, I’ll say thirty, maybe thirty ladies working in that department. So we’d go, the personnel office would join the other, called the main office at the Bates Division, and we’d have nice holiday Christmas party.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \\\\\n",

And everybody knew, the telephone operator, Evelyn, knew everybody and everybody knew her. She was a great lady, and very, very nice, 4 very informative, and good sense of humor. And I remember the nurse, too, the, can’t tell you her name. Florence was it? I’m not sure. The Industrial nurse that took care of the people if you had a minor accident. So, and there was another gentleman, Freddie, Freddie Banks, he handled payroll in the office. Again, in the office outside of personnel. And he, he was an interesting little fella. We’d always ask, what would you do if you get held up? Oh, he says, I’d give them the money, I’d give them the money, we’re insured. In those days, you used, the gentleman would go to the bank, assisted by a lady, I can’t think of her name, and they’d put the cash, your pay, cash, in an envelope. There were no checks. It was cash.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \\\\\n",

The, I don’t say the whole mill, I just know about the office people. And that got to be, you know, quite a bit of money, so they’d go to the bank and prepare that and bring it back, and then they’d come to your desk and hand you your envelope. But it was surprising, as you think of it today, to have all, go through all that cash, all the pennies in there and everything. So that was something you kind of remember. I enjoyed the time I spent there. I was quite young, and I had a family, and you did your work, the, you know, the best of your ability, you were proud, and you come home and took care of your family and next day went back to work. And also at that time, the week of the Fourth of July, the plant would close. And most other businesses in the twin city would close for the week. That was it, that was vacation week. Take it or leave it, that was vacation week. And, you know, the barbershop closed, a lot of the small mom and pop stores, and it was very quiet in town because everyone was on vacation. So, you know, everybody went out to the beach, and every place was very, you know, packed with people. It was fun, and you just took it for granted, that’s when you take your vacation, rain, shine or otherwise. And then all the machinery would stop, and then on the Monday you came back to work, everything had to be started up again. It was unique, you know, comparing it to today. Back then it was the going thing, you accepted it and that’s the way it was. But today, very different.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \\\\\n",

After, I don’t know how long, I was transferred from the personnel office to the converting office. Now, converting was a small office where you prepared the paperwork for this line that I mentioned earlier of the yard goods. The yard goods had to be sent to Rhode Island to a dye house where they, you know, put in the colors or the prints and all that, and you had to figure how much, oh what did they call it, I can’t remember, of the raw product to finish the colors and the prints on the material. So I worked in that office, and at the time I left it was due to a pregnancy. And when I returned a few months later, the type of longhand work, the job I was doing, was practically eliminated. It wasn’t the beginning of computers, but it was a system, I’m trying to think of the word, it was like a punch card system of sorts.

Once in a while as part of my duties, I’ll mention that, at the personnel office, you had to put up notices about the jobs. And I would walk through that whole mill, which is a huge building, on different floors, and I used to staple the notices on the bulletin board. And I 5 was five feet one, one inch, so there were times when I need a little help to get up with my stapler and put the, put up the notices on the board. So it was a little bit of a challenge, which sometimes I didn’t care to do.

She worked in the mill during the war, on a so-called victory shift, it was a partial second shift. I don’t know, I, if I recall, I was going to high school at the time, and I’d come home and she’d get ready to go to work. My brothers were in the military, and it was, I don’t know, four, six hour shift, something like that.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | \n",

You were close to your neighbors, you didn’t have, most people didn’t have a car, you walked. Didn’t take the bus too often. I don’t think we had busses, we had streetcars back then, and that was an experience. And, you know, people didn’t lock their doors, you just went in, in and out. And all the kids were happy. And we played outdoors, because, you know, no television. So we had a good upbringing. I went to, attended parochial school, and my brothers did, too, and that was pretty special. And it, it was easier, not as stressful as today. And everybody talked to everybody else, and it was, it was good. And you were poor, but you didn’t know you were poor, so you didn’t care. Didn’t make any difference. Everybody was the same, you know.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | \n",

And another thing, you had a, the refrigeration to keep your food was so-called ice box, so your mom had to provide continuous ice, you had to buy from the local ice man traveling up and down the street with his ice truck and buy a block of ice that would fit the ice box, so-called, and keep your food refrigerated. And one of the consequences I guess, the ice melts, and you have to have a bucket to pick up the water. And do not forget to empty the bucket, because it overflows on the kitchen floor, it ruins the ceiling for the tenant below you, and you’re in trouble. So we did our shopping right locally, and yes, it was fun. You’d walk up and down Lisbon Street like you do today in the mall. You had everything you wanted down there, you had your clothing stores, you had your hardware, you had barber shops, beauty shops, a few restaurants. And you could buy sewing needles to washing machines, whatever you needed, it was there. That’s why life was good, yeah. Didn’t have much money to spend, but it was okay. It was okay. We just managed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | \n",

We all spoke French, and then I learned English at the parochial school. It was St. Peter’s and Paul’s parochial school. And they just tore down that building there a few months ago, so that hurts. Because it was a lot of memories, and it was a nice, large building. I don’t know if you had a chance to see it. And we were, oh, six, four, five hundred kids. A lot, a lot of students there. And it was convenient. You didn’t have a cafeteria, you walked home for lunch, you walked home for lunch. So that took care of the day. You’d carry a big school bag with all your books, all your papers to do your homework at night, bring it back. And everybody was, well, was at the same level. By that I mean, we had a uniform. The girls wore a little black dress, usually with a little white collar, it was referred to as smock, and the moms sewed the little black uniforms and, in September, getting ready for a new school year, you outgrow them or you hand-me-down if you had a sister, the uniform would be handed down. So everybody looked alike, there was no, hey, what’s you wearing, you know, what are you going to wear tomorrow. Nothing, you just went to school and that was it. Of course we had nuns, the teachers were all nuns. And the school was divided, the girls would be taught by the nuns, the boys and girls up to I believe was grade four, five. I could be confused. Maybe it was grade f-. Anyway, at one point they separated, the boys went to one side of the building, a wing of the school, we went the, the girls went the other. But the boys, their teachers were male, they were from, well, I don’t want to say an organization but, it was the Brothers of the Sacred Heart that lived here in Lewiston that were teaching the boys. And the nuns were from the order of the Dominican nuns, they were teaching us, the girls. So it, it was interesting how things progressed as you got a little older. | \n",

He was, well, he was referred to as an insurance agent. He worked for the Prudential Insurance Company that sold life insurance at that time, so he was going house to house, collecting insurance, imagine that, and selling policies, and doing that in the twin cities. So there was never a lack of income because of, you know, getting laid off or a company making a change, or the Depression. So we were fortunate that way.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | \n",

So I came across some information where they were looking for an office girl in the personnel office at the mill, and the salary was so much better than the State was at that time. At that time. So I went for an interview, and I was lucky to be hired, and I made the change.

So we had a good group, got along very well and did our best to, you know, provide for the people seeking employment and keeping them posted on job changes or whatever needed to be done.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | \n",

And there was a lot of typing, a lot of handwritten reports, and a lot of filing. Gee, there was a lot of filing. You see, the employees belonged to a labor organization, the Textile Workers Union, and that means that you have a lot to do with seniority and job posting.

Because during the war, they were fabricating cloth for the military, I believe. And that was over, and they were going into a new phase. They were doing a lot of, well, the bedspreads, which Bates is very well known for that, and they were also doing yard goods. And the yard goods were very special, because they had come out at the time, I don’t know if that was, well, invented, if the process was locally or not, but the fabric got the title of discipline, the word discipline meant it was virtually wrinkle free. And that was unheard of in those days, you didn’t have to iron. If you made a dress or whatever you used the yard goods for, it was a nice cotton and it was disciplined. And it was sold here locally at the, at a store called Center’s & Giroux, they used to sell those yard goods, and the people benefited in the area from that. So, found out that the, the company made money with that because it was first on the market.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | \n",

But I knew that the Bates hockey team, they sponsored hockey and that was very, very popular in the area. I never did go to hockey games. I knew one of the players, and I also recall that the team went to Europe and they played in Europe, and they were very successful. I don’t know in what country, but. We used to have as employees, as a group, Christmas parties. But see, by working in the personnel office, we were only four people. But the other office in the Bates Division, the main office where Arthur Ford I believe was the manager, oh, there must have been, I hope I’ve got the right, they were many there. I don’t know, I’ll say thirty, maybe thirty ladies working in that department. So we’d go, the personnel office would join the other, called the main office at the Bates Division, and we’d have nice holiday Christmas party.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | \n",

And everybody knew, the telephone operator, Evelyn, knew everybody and everybody knew her. She was a great lady, and very, very nice, 4 very informative, and good sense of humor. And I remember the nurse, too, the, can’t tell you her name. Florence was it? I’m not sure. The Industrial nurse that took care of the people if you had a minor accident. So, and there was another gentleman, Freddie, Freddie Banks, he handled payroll in the office. Again, in the office outside of personnel. And he, he was an interesting little fella. We’d always ask, what would you do if you get held up? Oh, he says, I’d give them the money, I’d give them the money, we’re insured. In those days, you used, the gentleman would go to the bank, assisted by a lady, I can’t think of her name, and they’d put the cash, your pay, cash, in an envelope. There were no checks. It was cash.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | \n",

The, I don’t say the whole mill, I just know about the office people. And that got to be, you know, quite a bit of money, so they’d go to the bank and prepare that and bring it back, and then they’d come to your desk and hand you your envelope. But it was surprising, as you think of it today, to have all, go through all that cash, all the pennies in there and everything. So that was something you kind of remember. I enjoyed the time I spent there. I was quite young, and I had a family, and you did your work, the, you know, the best of your ability, you were proud, and you come home and took care of your family and next day went back to work. And also at that time, the week of the Fourth of July, the plant would close. And most other businesses in the twin city would close for the week. That was it, that was vacation week. Take it or leave it, that was vacation week. And, you know, the barbershop closed, a lot of the small mom and pop stores, and it was very quiet in town because everyone was on vacation. So, you know, everybody went out to the beach, and every place was very, you know, packed with people. It was fun, and you just took it for granted, that’s when you take your vacation, rain, shine or otherwise. And then all the machinery would stop, and then on the Monday you came back to work, everything had to be started up again. It was unique, you know, comparing it to today. Back then it was the going thing, you accepted it and that’s the way it was. But today, very different.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | \n",

After, I don’t know how long, I was transferred from the personnel office to the converting office. Now, converting was a small office where you prepared the paperwork for this line that I mentioned earlier of the yard goods. The yard goods had to be sent to Rhode Island to a dye house where they, you know, put in the colors or the prints and all that, and you had to figure how much, oh what did they call it, I can’t remember, of the raw product to finish the colors and the prints on the material. So I worked in that office, and at the time I left it was due to a pregnancy. And when I returned a few months later, the type of longhand work, the job I was doing, was practically eliminated. It wasn’t the beginning of computers, but it was a system, I’m trying to think of the word, it was like a punch card system of sorts.

Once in a while as part of my duties, I’ll mention that, at the personnel office, you had to put up notices about the jobs. And I would walk through that whole mill, which is a huge building, on different floors, and I used to staple the notices on the bulletin board. And I 5 was five feet one, one inch, so there were times when I need a little help to get up with my stapler and put the, put up the notices on the board. So it was a little bit of a challenge, which sometimes I didn’t care to do.

I was just, no, I don’t remember him doing that. However, before coming to Lewiston, to the mill town so-called, they lived in, my mother’s family lived in Canada, and my grandfather came to the United States to find employment.

       "17 Well, the city is very different, as compared to today, and it was, it was easier to live in those days. You were close to your neighbors, you didn’t have, most people didn’t have a car, you walked. Didn’t take the bus too often. I don’t think we had busses, we had streetcars back then, and that was an experience. And, you know, people didn’t lock their doors, you just went in, in and out. And all the kids were happy. And we played outdoors, because, you know, no television. So we had a good upbringing. I went to, attended parochial school, and my brothers did, too, and that was pretty special. And it, it was easier, not as stressful as today. And everybody talked to everybody else, and it was, it was good. And you were poor, but you didn’t know you were poor, so you didn’t care. Didn’t make any difference. Everybody was the same, you know.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "19 Well, we had groceries, we had a grocery store in the neighborhood, and you went there just about every other day, because it was convenient. And another thing, you had a, the refrigeration to keep your food was so-called ice box, so your mom had to provide continuous ice, you had to buy from the local ice man traveling up and down the street with his ice truck and buy a block of ice that would fit the ice box, so-called, and keep your food refrigerated. And one of the consequences I guess, the ice melts, and you have to have a bucket to pick up the water. And do not forget to empty the bucket, because it overflows on the kitchen floor, it ruins the ceiling for the tenant below you, and you’re in trouble. So we did our shopping right locally, and yes, it was fun. You’d walk up and down Lisbon Street like you do today in the mall. You had everything you wanted down there, you had your clothing stores, you had your hardware, you had barber shops, beauty shops, a few restaurants. And you could buy sewing needles to washing machines, whatever you needed, it was there. That’s why life was good, yeah. Didn’t have much money to spend, but it was okay. It was okay. We just managed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "21 Oh yes, hm-hmm, yeah. We all spoke French, and then I learned English at the parochial school. It was St. Peter’s and Paul’s parochial school. And they just tore down that building there a few months ago, so that hurts. Because it was a lot of memories, and it was a nice, large building. I don’t know if you had a chance to see it. And we were, oh, six, four, five hundred kids. A lot, a lot of students there. And it was convenient. You didn’t have a cafeteria, you walked home for lunch, you walked home for lunch. So that took care of the day. You’d carry a big school bag with all your books, all your papers to do your homework at night, bring it back. And everybody was, well, was at the same level. By that I mean, we had a uniform. The girls wore a little black dress, usually with a little white collar, it was referred to as smock, and the moms sewed the little black uniforms and, in September, getting ready for a new school year, you outgrow them or you hand-me-down if you had a sister, the uniform would be handed down. So everybody looked alike, there was no, hey, what’s you wearing, you know, what are you going to wear tomorrow. Nothing, you just went to school and that was it. Of course we had nuns, the teachers were all nuns. And the school was divided, the girls would be taught by the nuns, the boys and girls up to I believe was grade four, five. I could be confused. Maybe it was grade f-. Anyway, at one point they separated, the boys went to one side of the building, a wing of the school, we went the, the girls went the other. But the boys, their teachers were male, they were from, well, I don’t want to say an organization but, it was the Brothers of the Sacred Heart that lived here in Lewiston that were teaching the boys. And the nuns were from the order of the Dominican nuns, they were teaching us, the girls. So it, it was interesting how things progressed as you got a little older.\n",
       "23 My dad was, had a good job where, you know, his income was steady. He was, well, he was referred to as an insurance agent. He worked for the Prudential Insurance Company that sold life insurance at that time, so he was going house to house, collecting insurance, imagine that, and selling policies, and doing that in the twin cities. So there was never a lack of income because of, you know, getting laid off or a company making a change, or the Depression.

       "27 Between, after high school, before going to the mill, I was employed by the State of Maine at the State employment office located on Park Street back then.

       "29 Well, when you work at the employment office, you come across all these job openings, that’s the purpose of finding jobs for the unemployed. So I came across some information where they were looking for an office girl in the personnel office at the mill, and the salary was so much better than the State was at that time. At that time.

And there was a lot of typing, a lot of handwritten reports, and a lot of filing. Gee, there was a lot of filing. You see, the employees belonged to a labor organization, the Textile Workers Union, and that means that you have a lot to do with seniority and job posting. So the files were set up more or less according to that, so that besides being alphabetical by department by seniority, it involved a lot of details.

And there was also times when the people retired, or got laid off, that I was instrumental in talking to them and explaining their benefits, which was, you know, new to, it was new information for those people and they preferred to hear it in French so they didn’t get confused.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "41 Oh, yes, the mill was going, well I’d say full employment, full production, and they had a lot of orders, and it was towards the, let’s see, they had done away with the war emergency. Because during the war, they were fabricating cloth for the military, I believe. And that was over, and they were going into a new phase. They were doing a lot of, well, the bedspreads, which Bates is very well known for that, and they were also doing yard goods. And the yard goods were very special, because they had come out at the time, I don’t know if that was, well, invented, if the process was locally or not, but the fabric got the title of discipline, the word discipline meant it was virtually wrinkle free. And that was unheard of in those days, you didn’t have to iron. If you made a dress or whatever you used the yard goods for, it was a nice cotton and it was disciplined. And it was sold here locally at the, at a store called Center’s & Giroux, they used to sell those yard goods, and the people benefited in the area from that. So, found out that the, the company made money with that because it was first on the market.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "43 No, I don’t, no, I was never in bowling. But I knew that the Bates hockey team, they sponsored hockey and that was very, very popular in the area. I never did go to hockey games. I knew one of the players, and I also recall that the team went to Europe and they played in Europe, and they were very successful. I don’t know in what country, but. We used to have as employees, as a group, Christmas parties. But see, by working in the personnel office, we were only four people. But the other office in the Bates Division, the main office where Arthur Ford I believe was the manager, oh, there must have been, I hope I’ve got the right, they were many there. I don’t know, I’ll say thirty, maybe thirty ladies working in that department. So we’d go, the personnel office would join the other, called the main office at the Bates Division, and we’d have nice holiday Christmas party.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "45 No, I was mostly working right there in the personnel office. And everybody knew, the telephone operator, Evelyn, knew everybody and everybody knew her. She was a great lady, and very, very nice, 4 very informative, and good sense of humor. And I remember the nurse, too, the, can’t tell you her name. Florence was it? I’m not sure. The Industrial nurse that took care of the people if you had a minor accident. So, and there was another gentleman, Freddie, Freddie Banks, he handled payroll in the office. Again, in the office outside of personnel. And he, he was an interesting little fella. We’d always ask, what would you do if you get held up? Oh, he says, I’d give them the money, I’d give them the money, we’re insured. In those days, you used, the gentleman would go to the bank, assisted by a lady, I can’t think of her name, and they’d put the cash, your pay, cash, in an envelope. There were no checks. It was cash.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "47 When I was there in, you know, between 1951-1955. The, I don’t say the whole mill, I just know about the office people. And that got to be, you know, quite a bit of money, so they’d go to the bank and prepare that and bring it back, and then they’d come to your desk and hand you your envelope. But it was surprising, as you think of it today, to have all, go through all that cash, all the pennies in there and everything. So that was something you kind of remember. I enjoyed the time I spent there. I was quite young, and I had a family, and you did your work, the, you know, the best of your ability, you were proud, and you come home and took care of your family and next day went back to work. And also at that time, the week of the Fourth of July, the plant would close. And most other businesses in the twin city would close for the week. That was it, that was vacation week. Take it or leave it, that was vacation week. And, you know, the barbershop closed, a lot of the small mom and pop stores, and it was very quiet in town because everyone was on vacation. So, you know, everybody went out to the beach, and every place was very, you know, packed with people. It was fun, and you just took it for granted, that’s when you take your vacation, rain, shine or otherwise. And then all the machinery would stop, and then on the Monday you came back to work, everything had to be started up again. It was unique, you know, comparing it to today. Back then it was the going thing, you accepted it and that’s the way it was. But today, very different.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \n",
       "49 I left, I was transferred. After, I don’t know how long, I was transferred from the personnel office to the converting office. Now, converting was a small office where you prepared the paperwork for this line that I mentioned earlier of the yard goods. The yard goods had to be sent to Rhode Island to a dye house where they, you know, put in the colors or the prints and all that, and you had to figure how much, oh what did they call it, I can’t remember, of the raw product to finish the colors and the prints on the material. So I worked in that office, and at the time I left it was due to a pregnancy. And when I returned a few months later, the type of longhand work, the job I was doing, was practically eliminated. It wasn’t the beginning of computers, but it was a system, I’m trying to think of the word, it was like a punch card system of sorts.

       "53 Well, I think we’ve covered a lot. Once in a while as part of my duties, I’ll mention that, at the personnel office, you had to put up notices about the jobs. And I would walk through that whole mill, which is a huge building, on different floors, and I used to staple the notices on the bulletin board. And I 5 was five feet one, one inch, so there were times when I need a little help to get up with my stapler and put the, put up the notices on the board. So it was a little bit of a challenge, which sometimes I didn’t care to do. But you remember those little things, yeah.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",

However, before coming to Lewiston, to the mill town so-called, they lived in, my mother’s family lived in Canada, and my grandfather came to the United States to find employment. And at that time he worked in Lowell, Massachusetts where they had many cotton textiles. And then he brought the family from Canada to Lowell, Massachusetts, and my mother was born in Lowell. And then they came and settled in, here in Lewiston, and that’s where the, my mother was the oldest of three girls, and we’ve all been here in Lewiston ever since.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
